          "<p>Construction is an activity in which new or existing building is created for commercial use. New hotel to be redeveloped is in Mong Kok which is situated in western area of Hong Kong. The venture is planning to reconstruct its existing building. Present report discusses about proposal for enterprise and various construction method suitable for the redevelopment of hotel. Current issues in construction and modem methods of construction have been explained.  Moreover, impact of these issue on redevelopment of the building are discussed. Comparison of Greenfield and brownfield development has been done. Impact of modern construction method on traditional approaches are also evaluated. Analysis of current issues and modern techniques on the redevelopment project is also illustrated. Furthermore, analytical technique have been applied to review construction practices and condition of site. Design proposal for the redevelopment of new hotel is also discussed.</p>\n<p>1.1 Current construction issue and modern method of construction</p>\n<p>There are various issue that are faced by new hotel in Mong Kok which is popular hotel of Hong Kong. The hotel director is planning to re develop the hotel by removing the issues which are faced. Some of the issue are as follows: Labour & workforce shortage: One of the major issue which arrives while construction hotel is the shortage of labour and skilled workforce. Lack in availability of manpower impacts the construction of hotel (Zhang, Shen and Zhang, 2013). Qualified and skilled labour are required who know how to use tools and machines use in construction. This is the big issue faced by hotel. Construction cost: Renovating and redeveloping a new hotel in Mong Kok cost very high and it require large amount of capital. Construction of hotel requires funding and capital which is the major issue faced by hotel (Mok, Shen and Yang, 201). Timely renovation is require which costs high to the organisation. Redesigning and restructuring needs capital and architectural funding. Technology: Technology is rapidly changing and the organisation need to cope up with this emerging technology (Ma and et.al, 2013). Hotel need to build its premises which consist technical equipments and tools. Hotel in Mong Kok is currently lacking in technology due to which it need development and redesigning.</p>\n<p>1.1 Current construction issue and modern method of construction</p>\n<p>Three construction methods are there which can be used after demolition of existing building:Volumetric construction 3D volumetric construction is most popular construction method which can be used by director of hotel in Mong Kok in redevelopment of existing building hotel. It includes 3 dimensional units according to the condition of site(Fellows and Liu, 2015) .Module are used in 3 dimensional construction method in which modules use condition of building site and make units which are service intensive. Panellised Construction In panellised construction method is very helpful in rebuilding ion les amount of time (Khachatryan, 2015). In this method flat panel is made primarily on the off site and then it is assembled on the place where construction is to be done.  On assembling at site 3 dimensional structure is made to create windows, doors and many internal services.</p>\n<p>Hybrid concrete constructionThis construction method uses all the feature of both volumetric and panellised construction method.  It provides speed in construction and quality of work. It also requires low cost and provides high quality construction. It costs low and satisfies demand and expectation of clients. These structures build by hybrid approach hep are consistent and gives quality in building. Cos of construction using hybrid method is also moderate. 1.2 Implication of current construction issue of redevelopment of hotel project (70)Hotel in Mong Kok is facing various issues in construction which may impact the redesigning and redevelopment of hotel. Some of the impacts are as follows:</p>\n<li>Low skilled labour and unqualified labour may influence the reconstruction process of the hotel. Organisation requires high skilled labour in reconstruction process to make hotel according to the expectation (Ann and et.al, 201). Qualified labour and workforce is required for redevelopment project.</li>\n<li>Construction cost is the most important issue which can affect the reconstruction process of the organisation. Hight cost is required for redevelopment project.  Higher cost of modification of existing building can impact the predevelopment project (Hong and Wang, 2013).  Hotel needed proper amount of capital to make the changes according to need.</li>\n<li>Technology issue can also influence the reconstructing project of hotel. Hotel requires proper technical expertise to suggest best suitable method in redevelopment of building. Proper technological tools are required to make building. Technical experts are required as they can suggest best design and methods for reconstruction process.</li>\n<li>Lack of finance can affect the reconstruction process as it requires large amount of capital in rebuilding process. High amount of capital is required in reconstruction of the hotel.</li>\n<li>Appropriate time is also needed and lack of time can impact the redevelopment of building. Time is also a constraint which can impact the reconstruction process of the hotel (Tsang and et.al , 2014).</li>\n<li>Taxation system imposed by government is also a major issue which can impact the redevelopment of the new hotel. Local authority imposes various tax on the construction process of any organization.</li>\n<li>Various rules and regulations made by government in regard of construction also affects the redevelopment project of the hotel. Hotel authority need to follow the policies before starting its remodelling project. 1.3 Comparison between Green field development and brown field development of hotel There are two type of development of building of new hotel which are Greenfield development and brownfield development. Both the type of development are different from each other.  Comparison of them is as follows: Greenfield development Greenfield development is defined as creating a building on field which are undeveloped and unused. This field has no development previously and unused from a long time. These field are generally found at outskirts of the city like rural areas. Green field development focuses on providing living places to people at affordable prices. This development plan faces less issue of infrastructure unlike in urban areas. Greenfield development is more suitable rather than modifying the whole building. Green field development are cheaper than any development and requires low cost of construction. Greenfield included forest, open land are and wet fields (Jaillon and Poon, 2014). These field do not have any amount of hazardous materials. On the other hand developing a new field in outskirts can lead to deforestation and degradation of lands. Brownfield development: Brownfield development is defined as redeveloping the building which is used previously has some issue related to environment or politics. A brown field is a field which is developed previously but has no use currently. This field usually contains some problems like contaminations and pollutants (Li and et.al , 2013).  It is the process of restructuring the existing buildings and old building which are no longer in use.  This process is very expensive and require large amount of time and money. Predevelopment of existing one may not get appropriate amount of capital due to which sometime it leads to many political issues. Redevelopment of brownfield is sometimes necessary because of environmental concern. Contaminated fields sometimes release toxics which are harmful and causes health problem ion surroundings. In Addition to that brownfield reconstruction help in utilizing the existing building and can generate profits. New hotel in Mong Kok can use brownfield development approach because reconstruction can help hotel to generate more revenue and would give popularity in the market. Redevelopment of the hotel is necessary because it would help hotel to gain profits and revenue. Developing brownfield practice may help the organisation sustainability. 1.4 Benefits of development and redevelopment and their advantages and disadvantages Development Benefits There various benefits of developing a hotel in Mong Kok have many benefits by developing new hotel (Hong and et.al, 2015). Development of unused land and by constructing a new building can help hotel in resolving issues which it was facing previously. Development can support hotel to spark the economy of the place. New technology use would help hotel to provide service to customers according to their needs. New development would cost less than redeveloping the existing one (Lu and et.al, 2015). Hotel can incorporate the facilities which were lacking in the previous building. Development of hotel can increase in development of economy. Advantages Development help in making use of  unused land which  can help someone to generate revenue from it. It can attract the people to the area which is remain neglected for long times. Development also helps in making use of area  which is unused and not generating any profit to the local community. Disadvantages Developing new hotel sometime cause problem to the people, who are living in that area. It also lead to degradation and deforestation problem. Development can affect environment adversely. Development of nay new building in are causes problem to the local area people because it cause environmental pollution. Redevelopment Benefits The major benefit of redevelopment is that it give new life to the old building or hotel which are obsolete from years (Chan and et.al 2014). Redevelopment provides job opportunities and creates job for people through reconstruction process. Remodelling of hotel in Mong Kok will create employment opportunities. Redevelopment creates selling and buying of land easily and buyers easily get attracted to older reconstructed buildings. It helps in protecting environment because old buildings cause harms to environment by generating contamination. Existing building gets improve through remodelling and helps in economy developments. Advantages Redevelopment improves area without charging taxes on property.  It improvise the safety of environment and local surroundings. Remodelling of old building costs lower than modelling of new one. It increases the life and value of the existing hotel or building. Disadvantage One of the major disadvantage of remodelling is that it move out the people who are already living in the building to be reconstructed. In case of new hotel in Mong Kok it may possible that owner of hotel may remove employee who are working fir organization. Another drawback is that local area business may not get even after the redevelopment.TASK 2 2.1 Methods of construction to be adopted by hotel There are many methods available that can be adopted by hotel in Mong Kok area for reconstruction and redevelopment.  Four type of modern approaches that can be used are as follows: Flat slab method:  In this method flat slabs are used which are easily built because it uses modern from works.  Its making is simple and turnaround of slabs achieved by using striking from works and panellised construction (Khachatryan and et.al, 2015). Prefabricated service is used in this method which simplifies the positioning of slab. It save time of construction and overall cost. Flat slab manufacturing do not restricts the partitions. This approach provides flexibility by implementing changes in the internal structure. It requires less reinforcement and gives advantage to workforce. Hybrid concrete construction: This method of construction use attribute of both panellised and 3D volumetric construction method. Combination of these two provides strongest construction building (Ding and Xiao, 2014). It provide high speed in construction and results in good quality of work. It costs low and satisfies demand and expectation of clients. These structures build by hybrid approach hep are consistent and gives quality in building. Insulating Concrete form work method:  In this method of construction stretched polystyrene boards and twin walled block are used to build a formwork. This mixture is then use to create walls of building. This formwork is filled with ready to use mixture and concrete to make a robust construction. Walls made using this method are strongest and there is no risk of damage in this approach.  Stretched blocks of polystyrene gives high quality of thermal insulation. Concrete core gives strong and high level of insulation in sound. This method can be used by hotel for their reconstruction. Tunnel form: It is a method of construction in which a contractor is allowed to make walls and blocks in one operation on each day of construction cycle (Rashid and Yusoff , 2015).  This method constitutes speed and quality of concrete mixture provided by factory.  Ready to use mixture of concrete and formwork is flexibility in construction of building. This approach is useful in the projects which are repetitive. For example hotels, hostels and apartments for public. It also uses inherent advantage of concrete like fire and sound withstand. Formwork process in this method are very complex and they need crane carries the concrete during construction (Construction methods, 2017).  It is not appropriate for the sight which are congested and have no space outside. This technique can be sued by hotel in their redevelopment of the building. 2.2 Effect of modern methods  on traditional design process Modern methods of constructions are impacting tradition design process in many ways. Tradition methods of constructions are methods were very costly and causing harms to environment. There are various impact of modern methods of construction on traditional construction methods. Some of which are as follows: Less time requirement Modern approaches in constructing a building require a less amount of time as compare to traditional ones. These methods use elements which are off site where as traditional construction uses on site elements (Yuan. and Hao , 2013). Material used in conventional methods cause erosion problem. Due to this reason contractors now a days are using modern methods in building construction. Modern techniques are 60 percent faster than the traditional methods. Modern methods are integrated and precise due to which traditional ones are losing their existence rapidly. Cost effective Modern approaches are cost effective and cost predictability is easier in these methods. In traditional techniques of construction it was not possible to determine the cost earlier.80 percent of the cost of construction gets fixed in the modern approach. In on-site construction contractors are unable to find out overall cost of the development. This is the reason conventional methods are less used now a days. Non- conventional method saves money at each process of constructions (Chiang and et.al, 2014.). It also eliminate the cost of sub-contractors which get increase during life cycle of the project. Traditional ones are very expensive and now use of these methods in construction s becoming less. Superior Quality Modern techniques to manufacture buildings provides high quality of construction. Conventional methods are not efficient and do not produce standard quality of construction. Due to these drawbacks modern approaches of construction are replacing traditional techniques. Suitable for society and environment New methods of manufacturing are environment friendly as they do not causes harms to surroundings. Off site construction is planned and do not requires and designed in early stages. Energy requirements in performing off site manufacturing helps in improving process. Traditional methods requires lot of energy because of manual handing of every process. Material in offsite methods wastes less so contactor are using new approaches more than the conventional. Off-site techniques also provide sustainability in the field of construction.  Traditional methods also increase global warming and because of this reason new methods of construction are becoming popular (Candlin and Hyland, 2014). 2.3 Analytical techniques to review the design process of the project Review of design process  for the design process of the project  of hotel in Mong Kok  is as follows: Technical information: Technical knowledge is must for redeveloping the hotel building. Design process gets huge support if the contractor has good technical knowledge. Technical information is required to know identify the best construction methods for building procedure. Technology in construction process is used widely now a days.  In the design process of project analysis of technology is done which is used to find out the suitable methods. Construction practices:  Construction practices for developing new hotel in  Mong Kok hotel will support a lot in manufacturing process. Appropriate construction methods should be identified before designing of the whole project (Fellows and Liu, 2015). Break even technique can be used to find out the cost of each method. It is useful tool to  predict cost of construction. Proper construction practices should be done earlier to eliminate the risk in the mid of manufacturing process. Methods of working: Methods of working should be reviewed before starting construction project. It helps in identifying the safety and security of workers during the life cycle of project. Methods of working should be safe for worker and do not cause any harms to their health. Ground conditions: Condition of the place should be reviewed before starting the redevelopment of the new hotel Condition of ground is determined by analyzing the surface stability. In this analysis robustness of the location is determined. Intensity of the possible future events and their impact on the building is analyzed. Surrounding of the area should be reviewed before starting of construction Site restrictions: The location where the construction is to done should be analyzed by reviewing the restriction in the particular area (Zhang, Shen and Zhang, 2013). Owner of hotel in  Mong Kok should analyze that if there are any restrictions in redeveloping the building . It is required to review the rules and restriction regarding construction in particular location. Government policies: There are various policies made by government for the construction industry of Hong Kong. If the policies are beneficial for the hotel redevelopment project will get support from government.  Rules and regulation should be followed by hotel in redeveloping project. TASK 3 3.1 Design solution to tackle the problem s during redevelopment of hotel Redevelopment of the new hotel in Mong Kok can cause problem to neighbourhood, environment and traffic management . To reduce the impact of construction around project site a design solution is required. Design solution for the hotel project is as follows: Solution for the impact on neighbourhood Construction of hotel can cause serious problem to neighbourhood of locality. Activities in construction causes lot of sound and noise. This noise cause problem to people, who lives beside the project site. Hotel authority should take concern about the neighbour people. Public concern sometimes result in alternation of the plans made for development of building (Ann and et.al, 2013).  Hotel authority should  make balance between public issues and its construction activities. Machines used in construction process should generate low sound . Concrete and raw material which is required in building should not cause any harms to the local area people. Pollution due  to building process also causes  problem to people who live around the project site. Material used in construction of the hotel can cause air pollution  (Jaillon  and Poon, 2014). This pollution can affect the health of the people. Hotel authorities should make proper arrangement to store the material in covered place. It will help in controlling air pollution due to construction activities. Modern methods should be used by hotel contractor so that building process get faster. Modern equipment and machinery which produce less sound should be used in construction process. Solution for environment Construction process of hotel can impact environment to great extent.  Environmental factors include air pollution, water pollution, land degradation and many other problem.  Material used in building remain scattered outside due to which it cause harms to land. Pollution is also cause by the material. Machinery used in construction process releases smoke in the environment which results in air pollution (Jaillon, and Poon , 2014). Noise pollution also cause by construction activities which create problem to the local area community. Hotel authority should use machine in construction process which do not produce noise. It is required that land used during construction phase should be repaired after manufacturing gets completed. Natural resources should be used in limit for constructing building.  Hotel authority should follow the guidelines given for environment safety. Rule and regulation made for safety of environment should be acknowledged by authority before starting of project. Solution for traffic management Project site gets congested during construction process. Due to this traffic gets unmanageable and affects daily acclivities of people.  Hotel authority should make proper arrangement so that traffic do not get affected. Prior information about the construction should be given to local area people. Hotel authority should not cover the roads by raw material which is to be sued in manufacturing (Hong and et.al, 20150.  Roads should be clear in order to reduce traffic problems. Hotel authority should not block the way for it personal use as this can cause problems to the local area people. 3.2 Adoption of proposed methods and design solution In the redevelopment of new hotel contractor can use different methods of construction. Benefits of using various methods for client is as follows: Benefits of flat slab methods: This method can be useful for hotel as in this technique easily built slabs are used. This method uses prefabricated service which make the making of slab easier (Candlin and Hyland, 2014). It is a cost effective method which can help hotel to construct building in less amount of money. It is a flexible method which facilitates instillation of frame work easily.  It requires less amount of time in construction which is the major benefit of this technique. However this method is not suitable for the brittle partitions. Hybrid concrete construction:  New hotel for its redevelopment can use this method because it provides high speed in construction.  It use attributes of both panellised and 3D volumetric which provides the strongest construction (Khachatryan, 2015). This method produces high quality of work. Hotel can make use of this method because cost of construction using this technique is moderate. Risk of damage of building also reduces by using this methods in construction. Benefits of insulating concrete formwork method:  This method can be used by hotel in redevelopment as it gives high level of thermal insulation. It produces high level of insulation for sound and noise. Walls made using this method are strongest and there is no risk of damage in this approach. However this approach requires large amount of time. Cost of construction is also high in this method. Tunnel form construction method:  Tunnel form is very effective method that can be used by the hotel in redevelopment process. This method produces high quality of work and provides speed in construction process (Ma and et.al  2013). It is the best suitable method for the hotel redevelopment as it is generally use ion making of hotels, hostels and big apartments. It is very efficient method and provides high quality of work. Capital requirement in this method is high as compared to the previous methods. However this method is complex because of formwork process used in this technique. It is not suitable for the site which is congested and complex. This approach can be used by hotel to develop its building.  Conclusion From the above report it can be concluded that any new development requires a construction method which is best suitable for it. There are various issues in current construction methods which can impact the redevelopment process of the organisation. Modern methods of construction like hybrid, tunnel, insulation framework and 3 dimensional volumetric techniques are very efficient. These approaches produces high quality of work. There are various methods of development and redevelopment which can help in growth of hotel.  Brownfield and green field development are two most use development methods .New hotel in Mong Kok can use brownfield development approach because reconstruction can help hotel to generate more revenue and would give profitability  in the market. Brown field development is most suitable development method that can be used by hotel. Tunnel form method of construction can be used by the organisation in remodelling of building. It is required that hotel authority should review its construction practices, condition of ground, technology, restriction at site and government policies. Reviewing these factors will help hotel to redevelop its building in better References</li>\n<li>Taxation system imposed by government is also a major issue which can impact the redevelopment of the new hotel.

Presenting the amount of plant and equipment in balance sheet</h2>\n<p>In balance sheet, revaluate amount of plant and equipment is recorded by business entity after doing final reversal.</p>\n<h2>QUESTION 3</h2>\n<h2>Interpreting the technical requirements and importance of international accounting standards</h2>\n<p>International Accounting standards have high level of importance which ensures high level transparency and standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover, assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies. Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS. Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with financial reporting enumerated below:</p>\n<li>Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the regulations which business entity requires following for ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However, sometimes is not possible for the business organization to comply with all the rules to the large extent.</li>\n<li>Further, some government authorities have framed and introduced legislation which entail that companies are not obliged to prepare financial statements according to accounting standards. Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives also enforce accounting standard which company has to follow for the preparation of financial statements.</li>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<li>Bond, D., Govendir, B. and Wells, P., 2016.

Identification of Business</h2>\n<p><b>Describing government IT sector of Australia</b> Australian Government Information Management Office (AGIMO) – AGIMO works with government to make sure position of Australia as a leader in the creative application of communication and information technologies to administration of government, its services and information. AGIMO supervises the whole-of-government policy, strategies and standards’ development in regards to the Government of Australia use of communications and information technology (ICT) (Ojala andTyrväinen, 2011). AGIMO promotes the effective and efficient use of departments and agencies of government of Australia to increase national productivity and public sector. It achieves these aims and objectives by building ICT policies of whole-of-government to meet emerging issues and technology, analyzing and offering advice on important ICT proposals of government, providing rational direction to agencies, delivering programs to build skills of ICT, and supporting governance of ICT across government (Scale, 2009).</p>\n<h2>2. Strategy to Implement the Vision</h2>\n<p>2.1 Strategic goals and objectives to be achieved to implement the vision Strategic goals and objectives can be achieved with the help of performance indicators as well as critical success factors. A key performance indicator or performance indicator is a kind of measurement of performance. A company may use KPIs to assess a particular activity’s success in which it is involved. Sometimes success is described in terms of making growth toward goals that are strategic, but often it is simply the periodic, repeated achievement of some operational goal level. Accordingly, decide on the right KPIs relies upon a good comprehending of what is significant to the company. What is significant often depends on section measuring the performance, for e.g. the KPI’s helpful to finance will be too different from that of KPIs assigned to sales. Since there is a requirement to comprehend well what is significant to a company, various methods to review the present business state, and its major activities, are concerned with the performance indicators selection (Andrew, 2012). These reviewing often leads to determination of prospective improvements, so indicators of performance are regularly associated with improvement of performance initiatives. A quite common way to select KPIs is to apply a framework of management such as the balanced scorecard. Indicators marked and identifiable as likely candidates for KPIs can be sum up into the following sub-categories (Dihal and et.al., 2013)</p>\n<p>Quantitative indicators , Qualitative indicators, Leading indicators, Lagging indicators, Input indicators, Process indicators, Output indicators, Practical indicators, Directional indicators, Actionable indicators, Financial indicators. A company may apply all the above indicators which are commonly used to achieve strategic goals and objectives of the business. Organizational Principles:</p>\n<li>Chronological order – events, items or even ideas are positioned in the order in which they take place.</li>\n<li>Spatial order – In this, items are arranged in accordance to their physical relationships and position.</li>\n<li>Climactic order – In this, items are arranged to the most important from the least important.</li>\n<li>Topical order – It refers to the company which appears from the topic itself.

Hence, carrying amount is higher than recoverable cost which shows the loss of $90000. Carrying cost – recoverable amount $200000 – $110000 = $90000</p>\n<h2>D. Presenting the amount of plant and equipment in balance sheet</h2>\n<p>In balance sheet, revaluate amount of plant and equipment is recorded by business entity after doing final reversal.</p>\n<h2>QUESTION 3</h2>\n<h2>Interpreting the technical requirements and importance of international accounting standards</h2>\n<p>International Accounting standards have high level of importance which ensures high level transparency and standardization in the financial statements.</p><p>Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover, assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies. Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS. Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with financial reporting enumerated below:</p>\n<li>Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the regulations which business entity requires following for ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However, sometimes is not possible for the business organization to comply with all the rules to the large extent.</li>\n<li>Further, some government authorities have framed and introduced legislation which entail that companies are not obliged to prepare financial statements according to accounting standards. Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives also enforce accounting standard which company has to follow for the preparation of financial statements.</li>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<li>Bond, D., Govendir, B. and Wells, P., 2016.

          "<p>The Application Of The Precautionary Principle In The Conservation And Sustainable Use Of Marine Biodiversity Fishery management</p>\n<p>There is a direct relationship between the sustainable development of fishing and he is interested in the management & nbsp; to inform. In 1988, the 94th Session of FAO Council agreed that sustainable development is the management and conservation of natural resource bases. It also leads to positioning 's technological and institutional changes in a specific way to ensure that meets and continues to meet relevant human needs for future . current and future generations. Strategies are also needed to achieve the sustainability of high levels of human use of renewable natural resources, moreover, is not even easy to trust and use. There is also a growing need to improve conventional fisheries management of and this should be linked to the growing concern of for better management of environmental issues. This was developed by the World Conference on the Human Environment and Fisheries Development and Management.</p>\n<p>It also indicates that the current state of fisheries is due to poor management by the competent authorities. Thus, it has also been determined that in natural ecosystems the abundances of predators and predators and their variations are controlled and maintained within a compatible limit . on the sustainability of the ecosystem. Therefore, in this regard, it can be said that the concept of the precautionary principle aims to improve the conservation of the environment and of the available resources by reducing the risk of harming them. . In addition, it also intends to promote and find a fair balance in the short term, against the current degradation of the environment and overfishing. includes two fundamental principles such that it reinforces the need to protect the environment but also intends to encourage the obstacle corresponding to potential risks. The other, however, is worried about wiping out risks. From now on, it is clear that the application of this principle in fishing came about in response to the vision of condition concerning resources and inefficiencies that justify the sustainability of the fishing industry. activity ..</p>\n<p>Tropical reefs</p>\n<p>CMouth coral reefs can be characterized as one of the most biologically rich ecosystems on earth, which help provide food, employment, money and security to people around the world. However, appropriate action must be taken, or the reefs and stunning creatures could be a danger as soon as it emerges. They can be threatened by a growing range of influences in the form of pollution, 4,444 diseases and possibly also global climate change. At the same time, it has also been observed that early engagement of these aspects can reduce the loss of valuable ancient ecosystems with significant social, economic and environmental consequences. around the world. For example, the President of the United States established Coral Reef Task Force in 1998 with the purpose of protecting and conserving coral reefs. CRTF is obligated to carry out mapping and monitoring missions of coral reefs in the United States, further assisting research related to the causes of reef degradation . This also includes pollution and overfishing and in addition , it also finds solutions to these problems. In addition, it also promotes the conservation of the good use of coral reefs. NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) is a senior member of the CRTF; it is therefore responsible for the conservation of 4,444 coral reef ecosystems. All efforts are made through Coral Reef Conservation Program which works with scientific, governmental and non-governmental organization to achieve CRTF goals. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration also used high-resolution satellite imagery and global positioning satellite technologies to help create a digital map of the reefs of Puerto Rico. . It also uses satellite technology to detect harmful algal blooms that have the potential to extinguish coral reefs and on top of that, it monitors rising sea surface temperatures. high can cause coral bleaching . The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration acts as a safeguard through which biodiversity can be managed and maintained. It also facilitates monitoring of coral reefs using the Reef Early Warning System consisting of buoys deployed at reef sites to measure air temperature, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure. , sea temperature and tide level. However, in addition to the monitoring process mentioned above, it also supports the research, assessment and implementation of reef restoration projects in marine protected areas and on the deep sea reefs..</p>\n<p>Additionally, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is also working to remove tons of marine debris from the Northwest Hawaiian Islands and restore damaged coral reefs. Based on the discussion, it can be said that monitoring, research as well as rehabilitation of is imperative for the protection of coral reefs. However, for optimal protection, legal mechanisms also need to be followed. On the legal level, it is about the establishment of marine protected areas as it adds the force of law (protected marine encirclement). This is an important part of the reef system that can also improve the ecosystem's chance of survival .</p>\n<p>Marine reserves</p>\n<p>Marine Protected Areas indicate areas where 4,444 human activities lead to population reductions directly or indirectly through 4,444 habitat changes. This eliminates the risks to a greater extent. This spatially clear approach helps manage human influences, which have many potential ecological and socioeconomic benefits . This can raise the issue of the need for accepted management practices; therefore, it can benefit common practices. Precautionary principles have been developed for conservation and management of because they include models related to random design, implementation, performance, and judgment . This often produces contradictory and contradictory evidence from both an ecological and evaluative point of view. & Nbsp; Example: - lack of sufficient scientific certainty about the species of marine life which are threatened with extinction and which are also more threatened than the species associated with marine ecosystems. In this regard, the governing bodies have established the establishment of marine protected areas, which are one of the tools that work to protect the integrity of marine ecosystems and biodiversity. On the other hand, also supports the protection and recovery of endangered marine species through the application of the precautionary principle. It also acts as a management strategy protecting the value of marine life. Additional protection of ecosystems through the principle of prevention may be threatened Endangered species are also protected by various other strategies. Apparently 4,444 threatened species include three categories of extinct and threatened species, of which 4,444 marine species are more at risk. The application of the principles of prevention in this area of ​​concern as a process of implementation of the MPA and this also protects threatened species, assesses the potential risks in the management of these areas and species. It also involves analyzing some of the factors that create and manage the other 4,444 domains. It also emphasizes some common management practices ; it can therefore replace other practices. The challenges are many for 4,444 managers as well as conservation scientists and economists. One of the major challenges facing managers is to promote consensus among stakeholders on the system proposed by the AMP. It also prepared 4,444 national action plans for species conservation and restoration. At the same time, 4,444 specific policies are also being developed to protect and restore species, and 4,444 are authorized for potentially or effective polluting activities. Therefore, it can be said that the application of the precautionary principle to the conservation of biodiversity and marine natural resources constitutes one of the basic tools in the direction of sustainable development. It also provides guidance for the operation and management of the when responding to risk and uncertainty. Thus, it can be said that in collaboration with the federal government and the courts of first instance, this regulation was drawn up as a precautionary principle for the conservation of marine protected areas. Given the natural acceptability of this population and the communities of coastal marine species, the spread of reproductive propagules is important for marine conservation, which also contributes to enhancing the value of the ecosystem. In addition, many species have a limited dispersal capacity. Thus, it is clear that many species have a limited dispersal capacity of species, which also suggests that local populations of species with large dispersal capacities may recover to some extent. Coastal Marine Protected Areas In general, MPAs are known for areas for which preventive protection and restoration measures have been established to protect and preserve the species that exist in the ecosystems, habitats, ecosystems and ecosystems procedural aspects of the marine environment. In this context, OSPAR Ministers agreed to this to encourage the development of the network protecting marine areas and it also follows schedule leading up to the preparatory work. This is typically set up to develop an ecologically coherent MPA network in the Northeast Atlantic also appropriately managed by the OSPAR network. This organization was established with the aim of protecting, conserving and restoring species, habitats and ecological processes that may encounter problems related to human activities. It also helps to prevent degradation and damage to species, ecological habits and processes taking into account the precautionary principle. This also protects and conserves areas that represent the diverse habitats present in environments especially in maritime areas. Progress has been made by the ongoing Parties, which also identify, select and establish MPAs as the main mechanisms of the OSPAR network. This was included in the latest online progress report, which also includes a framework outlining the network. There are a number of laws developed by government agencies that are also intended to be followed. The Precautionary Principle and this was generally followed in the global regulatory framework in the mid-1980s. It also indicates that Principle is useful in providing guidance on the conduct of international studies . economic uncertainty, when 'There is also scientific uncertainty . At the same time, it is also reflected in Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration , and also presents a number of threats that could even cause adverse effects on the environment. This could therefore be used as a factor delaying important efficiency measures in terms of protecting the environment from certain harmful aspects. The standards are also helpful in suggesting that appropriate measures should be taken with scientific evidence so that they can protect significantly from environmental damage. In this area, the preventive approach has been applied because it is based on the relation that includes promising means to support the protection of the environment in different aspects. Therefore, it also states that before implementing any plan, evidence should be considered for adverse effects. It also shows that 4,444 precautionary principles are often applied in order to</p>\n<h2>National sanctuaries</h2>\n<p>Protecting the environment and national protected areas is essential to be protected and to do so, the government has established a number of laws and regulatory requirements which also provide protection measures to improve the quality of the environment. In concurrently, the government enacted the Environmental Protection Management Act which was developed with the aim of improving aspects of sustainable development, an important aspect of the ecosystem . In the context In this regard, we can say that the principle of prevention is essential because it helps to achieve the development of environmental aspects. It is also established that if there are threats that could damage the environment, it could affect the set of environment values. This also shows that there is scientific certainty that plays an important role in adopting new measures to protect the degradation of environmental aspects. Although the EPA is practical and is also primarily concerned with the challenges associated with pollution in water treatment. Therefore, does not have broad authority to engage in regulatory policy adopted by other organizations and agencies in the environmental context. Section is also mentioned in the Environmental Management Protection Act, that organizations can give specific instructions to public bodies and private councils (which work in this area ). ) so that they can perform certain actions according to the powers they have. It will also help to contribute to the protection of the environment and at the same time it can also reduce any activities which may harm the value of the environmental aspects. Therefore, it is also analyzed that environmental protection includes activities related to the protection, restoration and maintenance of ecologically sustainable development. It also provides information about EPA which needs some negotiating and negotiating power as well as those environmental sources and agencies with which it may be more involved. Speaking of activities, it can be said that although the EPA has become increasingly active in the field of biodiversity conservation through the involvement of in the protection of waterways and the authorization, so far it has not shown that was inclined to participate. . in terms of biodiversity conservation on 4,444 private lands. For example, in the Leatch v National Parks and Wildlife service 81 LGERA 270 Stein J made it clear that not specifically incorporating Principle into law is not the end of the matter. In this case , the principle of legal precaution is not applicable by virtue of the principle necessary for eco-sustainable development, however, the principle is flexible enough to accommodate it. The case also involves a third party appeal for the purpose of issuing permits to limit endangered species that often destroy existing habitat in the ecosystem. The Hedging Principles appear to provide a regulatory framework that takes into account the impact of uncertainty. In , it is also responsible for providing advice on actions that may pose a serious risk to the environment or human health aspects. This suggests a lack of scientific certainty usually indicates harm. At the same time, Principle also presents a formalized procedure for delaying action until damages become certain and at the same time, this usually means delay. In this context, it can be said that preventive measure becomes accurate at a time when threats are present to the environment and when the formulation of specific policies does not exist while correcting them. change aspects of the environment. On the other hand, however, a certain formula provides additional guidance, also covering some aspects where changes the value of the precaution. Along with this, a science-based risk assessment can also be considered important because it is an important aspect that is used in the field of prevention. Precautionary requirements are developing at a time when certain threats to the environment exist; however, one also notes that this aspect of the precautionary principle is not as important. It is also limited to irreparable damage, of which there is no protection clause and it only states the necessary condition lacks scientific certainty. It should therefore not be seen as an aspect which results in obligations which are also profitable in nature..</p>\n<p>Marine Parks</p>\n<p>The Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 has been helpful in providing disclosure and management of Commonwealth Reserves. This is also published under the EPBC Act which covers Commonwealth land reserves such as national parks, botanical reserves and nature reserves . Statutory rights are also defined. is entitled to assist in the management and control of Commonwealth Reserve functions under the EPBC Act . Practices often include the protection and management of aspects of biodiversity in the protection of Commonwealth reserves. It also contains published provisions for Commonwealth Marine Protected Areas operating in Marine Area and also administered by the Governor General of Australia. Authority is responsible for the area from the sea boundary line of the coastal waters of the State and the Northern Territory to outside the exclusive economic zone at 200 nautical miles which is also far from the baselines. headquarters of the territorial sea .</p>\n<p>However, areas outside Australia have some legal aspects protect the international agreement and also provide some guidelines on the protection of marine parks. In addition, EPBC Law also has a procedural value that must be complied with before a declaration interferes with a Commonwealth reservation. This procedure also focuses on determining which comments to invite public authorities on proposal and then declaring a reservation to the Commonwealth. Therefore, in addition, the various steps are also included and must be taken into account if the reserve is met according to established guidelines. is also required for entities including a disclosure statement that considers the name of the reserve, the purpose of its claim, the depth of the seabed under any waters that exist within the reserve. and the allocation from the protected area to an IUCN Category.</p>\n<p>This notice is essential in separating a protected area into different areas and at the same time, it should also assign the IUCN category to each area as sites. IUCN catalogs generally guarantee the conformity of the specification of aspects of protection of different sectors. For example, the Australian government also focuses on World Conservation Union international base , which also recognizes a set of protected area management categories. In this regard, Commonwealth Marine Protected Areas include protected areas that are related to the IUCN list. In addition, there are various general administrative principles of the Commonwealth Marine Protected Areas which must follow so that conservation aspects can be properly managed. It also requires community involvement to be able to provide broader reach in the context of the community involvement, public organizations and private interests in formulating and conducting all function reserve or area .</p>\n<p>This notice is essential in separating a protected area into different areas and at the same time, it should also assign the IUCN category to each area as sites.

Manager: Hello sir how may I help you? Customer: I have called you to tell you about the inappropriate services of your hotel. I am unhappy with the response of your staff members. They have no realization of their responsibilities. No one is there to pick my luggage when I had entered the hotel. Due to the unpleasant behaviour of the staff members the luggage had been taken by myself to the room. My office meeting was completely messed up because the services are not provided to me on time so I have been late to the office. Manager: Sorry for the inconvenience sir. We are feeling so embarrassed to hear all these things but next time we will take care of each thing which will fulfil all you desire.

          "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Game development may be as a process of designing and introducing the creative aspects which entertain people to the large extent. Now, gaming industry is facing high level of competition which have major impact on firm’s profitability which are operating in such sector. In this, report will provide deeper insight about the extent to which mobile and tablet devices have influenced or encouraged everyone to play game. This report will also develop understanding about the games which attract large number along with the significant or valid reason.</p>\n<h2>Background of the study</h2>\n<p>At present, the video game industry is developing at a very high rate and places great importance on business expansion. In addition, every individual now has a smartphone containing a number of games and other applications. This aspect has an intense individual interest and therefore has contributed to the growth and development of this gaming industry (Castro Soeiro et.al., 2016). Today, motivated to spend time happily, 4,444 people play the game on their mobile phones. & Nbsp; The Pokémon go game is one of the greatest examples of video games that have generated great popularity. Every 4,444 people with a smartphone are encouraged to download and play such games. In this, people are tasked with catching Pokémon that are present in many different places. In this way, the interest level of individuals has increased significantly in recent times. In , in this respect, it can be said that smartphones and tablets encourage more than people to play games..</p>\n<h2>Research questions</h2>\n<p>In this study, the research question focuses on the extent to which 4,444 tablets and smartphones encourage people to play games. Therefore, from survey , it was estimated that the use of cell phones in contact games has increased with very high rates of . In addition, individuals can play the game of anyone. where, which in games also pushes them towards that. Additionally, game companies now design 4,444 battery-saving games with designs that appeal to people (Castañeda & Cho, 2016). In addition to , video games to a large extent strengthen and improve the skills, competences and qualifications of 's staff. Video games played repeatedly by people help develop their levels of patience and perseverance. Tablet and smartphone users are constantly playing their favorite games . This in turn contributes to their growth and development side . Role-playing games like Final Fantasy, Dragon Warrior, etc makes everyone stronger. Along with that, there are some 4,444 video games available that people can play on their phones like trees vs. zombies, 4,444 angry birds, etc. All these games develop the capacities of individuals in terms of strategic thinking and forward-looking planning (Carvalho and Araújo, 2016). So, other major aspects influence people to play the game and thus increase 's potential.\nAlong with this, friendship groups are also encouraged to play games with other people using smartphones. By the way, these games maximize & nbsp; leadership & nbsp; and socialization to a large extent. Now, there are 4,444 games that allow people to spend time together. Besides this , there are a number of online games for individuals that provide opportunities for people to communicate with each other through voice and video chat. In addition, to develop mental tablets and creative power, and 4,444 mobile phone users have touched to play games (Ebner et.al., 2016). Games Sudoku, Tetris, etc. significantly improved brain function in 4,444 people. When people started playing a particular game , their desire to take each step increased to at a very high rate (Skill Development through Video Games, 2017). In this way, by solving all logical inferences individually can improve mental capacity to a considerable .\nIn addition, Tetris game improves pattern recognition skills and facilitates mental practice . Thus, such games allow the individual to think outside the box and thus achieve his or her goals. me. In addition, all games mentioned above do not take up more space in phone memory and thus encourage people to play games.

          "<h2>Student plagiarism and professional practice</h2>\n<p>The internet is the biggest and foremost source of information which can be accessed easily to retrieve any type of information. This has made internet most preferred source for collecting information by any person regardless of his/ her age. I have seen that nowadays, various projects in schools and colleges that are asked from students to make are not done in a proper way. They are just plagiarised from various internet sources without any original researches. The plagiarism refers to naming others’ work as own. The projects assigned to students has the purpose of increasing knowledge from practical aspect along with enhancement of research work. In case of nursing education I have seen this problem which is more fierce where generally, seniors use to plagiarise or name the work of their juniors as their own. In UK this problem has enhanced at a high level in current situation (Falchikov, 2013). This issue has an adverse impact on various pre and post nursing courses which ultimately degrades the professionalism in students. The plagiarism has become an international issue where I found in UK that various nursing professionals and midwifery councils are forced to maintain the reputation of health and care profession along with corresponding to professional code of conduct. Various discussions that I have read and researched about this issue has acknowledged me that the act of plagiarism has serious implications on professionalism. Thus, it becomes necessary to find a solution for this challenging issue in the current scenario as soon as possible (Roig, 2011). The basic meaning of plagiarism is to make others’ work own without mentioning its credible source anywhere. Because of this, many institutions have considered this act as cheating and also termed it as a serious offence. I have learnt that the act of plagiarism is a big misconduct that should be avoided in any case. It is apparent in the current scenario that many technological developments have been done in this field to restrict the practices of plagiarism. But I found it very unfortunate that this issue is becoming more harder to control as students are using this approach in more careful and sophisticated way. I referred the report of various recent medical councils through which it was discovered that these councils have considered this issue in case of medical students who are currently practising. Various senior associated who are concerned with this issue has left this issue of fraud or plagiarism on individual medical schools (Lampert, 2014). Further, different medical councils have commonly agreed that related authorities must make some new laws in this regard so that this situation can be ameliorated. However, the authorities suggest that individual medical councils and colleges may resolve this issue by constructing some rules by posing penalties as they consider fit for restricting mentioned practice. By reading the article on plagiarism I have come to know that this act is much serious concern in present time which should be resolved as soon as possible. The reading of articles has asserted that plagiarism can be done through many ways which is most probably comes out of group tasks. There are more possibilities in group works that student do their work as a team and of them may claim the entire work as his own. Similarly, I have noted that most of the times students use to help each other and submit their copied work from friends. Another way is internet where nowadays many sites have come on internet which provide free or chargeable essays on desired topics (Angélil-Carter, 2014). Thus, overall more than 30% students use to copy the material of assignments and researches from internet and many other sources. In this concern, the professor of Singapore has admitted this practice as Alteration and amendment. The problem has affected not only UK but various other countries as well. As per the various researches and articles, I think that solution to this problem can be developed with the help of moral principles. It is necessary for student s to know about ethics and morality so that they can successfully decide that what is right an d what is wrong. In various professions like nursing, before registration to become a professional practitioner, it is necessary that student develops within themselves assorted ethical and moral principles (Elander and et.al., 2010). The professional qualification of a student should not be just limited to their degrees but it should be extended to honesty and trustworthiness as well. This is necessary as the student who is indulging in plagiarism at any stage of learning and training will not gain the required knowledge. This will be a definite loss for students and also for the institution promoting that student. By the researches I found many reasons due to which students use to do plagiarism. In context of nursing students, there is a difficult task for them to balance the life between academic practices along with various competencies required in profession. Further, it is also manifested that in this profession that many of the students entering this field are enough matured and married. As per this, it becomes very difficult for them to manage the work of academics and their parental responsibilities (Löfström & Kupila, 2013). Most of the times the work load become heavy which makes enough pressurising for students to manage their work and maintaining quality in it. This becomes some obvious reason which has increased the practice of plagiarism. For this, it is necessary to maintain basic values by the key professionals so that they can develop the moral and necessary values within students whether thay are entering in pre or post registration. In my point of view whatever be the reason of plagiarism, it cannot lessen the impact and result of the act (Heitman & Litewka, 2011). But, it is necessary to remove this issue from the scenario as bounding into a professional code of conduct and posing some penalties will not fulfil the purpose in proper way. Here, the professionals and higher authorities should work as a role model by keeping themselves as the example before students so that they can develop values and ethics. This example of presenting the role model should be presented at each and every stage of assigning work, giving seminars and sharing information. The ethical concern in this issue lies with honesty which is necessary to be maintained. But involving in plagiarism leads to a kind of fraud whether it is done on any stage (Jiang, Emmerton & McKauge, 2013). In context of health care profession, I think this is a more serious concern as cheating at the time of learning or training may cause a serious results for clients or patients in future. Various practical cases have seen in such scenario where about 50% students have admitted the act of plagiarism in nursing profession intentionally or unintentionally. This act leads a serious damage to the professionalism. Therefore, it is necessary to take some strict steps that can restrict student to execute this act. For enhancing their professional degree, students use to indulge in act of cheating which if discovered may lead to serious consequences. I think, for this concern, it is necessary to develop changes in current practices so that students may develop their interest in learning instead of cheating (Kift, Nelson & Clarke, 2010). To restrict the practice of plagiarism, it is necessary to develop new policies and norms necessary to confine practice of plagiarism. I also recommend that the institutions on individual basis and various councils commonly develop some rules in this regard so that students can maintain transparency in their work. The institutions may make a formal and common meeting among themselves to discuss the matter. The high professionals should make students to understand the necessity of fairness in their work in present and future context as well. The strict implementation of penalties in the case of plagiarism should be posed which should be detected from highly efficient software (Xiao, 2010). In addition, the development of ethical and moral concerns among students will be the most useful tool for restricting the practice of plagiarism. By summarising the entire study, I found that the plagiarism is a serious concern that should be solved as soon as possible. It is also evident that students who are under training in the nursing profession also use to indulge in cheating which leads to fraudulent practices with clients. For solving this problem it is necessary that the higher authorities set examples before students and develop the sense of values and ethical behaviour so that work can be maintained without any plagiarism (Evering & Moorman, 2012).\nReferences</p>\n<li>Angélil-Carter, S.

          "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Before entering into university I was a bit nervous about what subject I must choose for developing a better and successful career. But then after assessing several information and future success scope they provide, I decided to opt for Business management because this provide student an overall development opportunity. The current report is a reflective essay which includes personal experience while studying within the university. This assignment is divided into two parts where first task is about what help me in developing as a learner and second task is about how this learning will help in approaching future challenges and expectation of university course.\nTASK 1\nAs studying into college brings on several positive as well as negative experience which support a person in its development and growth for future success. I also move through several things that has supported me in enhancing my skills and knowledge. There are number of activities that are performed in this university during my course which supported me up to a great extend in improving my knowledge. During classroom lectures we are assigned with a some group work where I had learned about several new things as in group we generally share our knowledge with one another. This supported me in increasing my knowledge as by having group discussion I came to learn about things which are not covered during our classes  (Uhl and Gollenia, 2016). Apart from this group work also supported in developing team work skills and ways to resolve the conflicts that may arises while working in a group. In addition to this it also supported me in identifying the common mistakes that are made during work which can affect the presentation of work done. Apart from this through group work I also came to know about the way through which research cam be perform in a better way. It also includes different methods through which relevant information can be collected that support in evidencing the research work. This help me in learning that what things to be consider while making a selection of source for collecting information. For completing our group work assignment we also performed online research for collecting the content related to our topic. This help us in exploring our knowledge by reading about different facts or information which are related with our current topic. This support us in identifying several queries that we have regarding our topic and then we discussed it with our lecturer. These activities throughout our course supported me in developing my reading and writing skills as students are grouped by lecturers for assigning the particular topic to research over and developing a report over it (Schaper and et. al., 2014). Apart from this it also supported in developing me as a good researchers and also provide and opportunity to explore or enhance my knowledge through online learning as well as by share own knowledge within group. In addition to this it also supported in developing an understanding of how to work in a team and cooperate with other to achieve the desire objectives.\nTASK 2\nThough college brings on several learning and development opportunities for students, but it is not always be possible for a person to learn things over a first attempt. I have learned so many things from group work that was assigned by our teacher for improving our knowledge as well as understanding regarding my course. As group discussion open up several facts or information which is not possible to cover within a lecture. This activity help me in developing my reading, writing, researching and team work skills that will support in my career. But apart from this, I was not able to improve my presentation skills. Because while working in a group the work was divided among group members to simplify it and performing in an effective manner. Therefore, I didn’t get a chance to represent a power point presentation regarding the information about topic. Because of which my hesitation of giving a presentation and speaking up in front of people still remains the same. This may affect my future performance as I don’t have any knowledge about how to give presentation in front of others which is more explanatory  and informative. But I have decide to work over it for developing my presentation as well as communicational skills by taking addition classes for it. I have decided to research online about how to make a presentation more effective which support in garbing the attention of listeners. In addition to this I will also attend seminar and other guest lectures that our university organise for students to develop among them presentation and inter personal skill for their career advancement (Burns and Dewhurst, 2016). These all support in developing presentation skills which is very essential for a management student as they have to give presentation several time during meeting as  part of their job. Apart from this communication skill is also an essential part of a management student for getting a better job and performing effectively over it. So in order to improve it I have decided to take participate other several activities like debate, group discussion etc. This support in improving the communication skills and also help in removing the hesitation of speaking up in public (Mariotti and Glackin, 2015). These both plans will support in improving my presentation as well as communicational skills which support in dealing with future challenges that may be faced during assignments as well as task given by lecturers which I required to be present and explained in front of others\nConclusion\nFrom the above report it can be summarised the business management course is a overall development program for a student which support them in learning several different skills throughout their course. These abilities support them in developing a base for better future and career. It includes reading, writing, presentation, researching, information gathering, data analysing and communication skills. These skills support them in presenting their work in an more efficient manner and also support them in influencing others for working as a team toward accomplishment of a common goal.\nPART 2\nPortfolio Evidence:- How can business grow The topic selected for the portfolio of evidence is “How can business grow”, as it is one of the most crucial factor under the concept of business management. This topic provide a detail explanation about various methods or tactics that a person must use in order to make its business grow and sustain in competitive environment (Ward, 2016). The portfolio includes the description of various factors that a company must consider and try to improve over it by brining some unique ideas for  standing apart among rivals. The idea behind selecting the topic “How can business grow” for populating a portfolio is that it is most prominent factor within the business environment. It provide a detail understanding about the sources or tactics that can be used within the business to  maintain its position within the marketplace. It depict about the ways through which a business can create value in front of its customers. As for the growth and sustainability of a business, it is very essential for a company to deliver quality of services to its customers and try to satisfy their need or expectations through their offerings. For creating value among customers it is also very essential for a company to fulfil the promises which they made with its users and ensuring their satisfaction with their services. In addition to this for keeping business grow, a company always try to bring innovation in their current product or services. This will support in enhancing the quality of product as per the requirement of end users and also help in  keeping customers engaged with business for a longer period of time  (Swift and Piff, 2014). This is because when the need of customers get fulfilled, they started demanding more and if company remain stick over single product then their target market will switch to other competitors for satisfying their expectation. The information for portfolio is selected through internet, library, newspaper, magazines, case study and study material. From which the internet is selected as a major source of information’s collection in order to evidence the facts of portfolio. The reason behind selecting this source is that it is more reliable source which provided accurate and current information about the various tactics that companies generally uses for the growth of their business. Apart from this internet provide information in a wider context and evident it with different theories or models given by philosophers all around the world. This supported me up-to a great extend in collecting information and developing an understanding about the measures as well as action that must be taken for business growth. In addition to this case studies in books and magazines also supported me in gaining a knowledge regarding tactics that a company must use for its future growth (Dalton, 2017). Further these case studies also supported in identifying the ways through which companies can overcome from their situation and bring their business back to its growth stage.\nReferences</p>\n<li>Burns, P. and Dewhurst, J. eds., 2016.

          "<h2>Chapter 1: Introduction</h2>\n<h2><strong>1.1 Overview and background of the research</strong></h2>\n<p>With rise of globalisation, organisations get opportunity to expand their business in international market, more easily. It helps in enhancing customer base and developing high economy to run business successfully (Phau, Teah and Chuah, 2015). In context with companies dealing in fashion industry, expanding business at global level, not only provide benefits but also give various challenges. As when so many companies run their business on same marketplace, then it rises competition among them. In addition to this, getting a range of products on different-different price rates also impact on behaviour of customers. As they demand more from trendy and fashionable clothes that suits their personality from organisations. Therefore, to complete desires of targeted customers and exceed level of satisfaction, create various difficulties for such companies. In context with M&S, it is considered as one of the best fashion retailer industries in UK. It has opened more than 300 stores in 40 overseas locations to enhance its customer base. But with rise of globalisation, it faces various issues related to social attitude in fashion industry.</p>\n<h2><strong>1.2 Research Aim, objectives and questions</strong></h2>\n<p>In order to conduct a research in systematic manner, it is essential for researchers to formulate appropriate aims and objectives. This would help in monitoring the entire activities related to survey for obtaining higher outcomes (Kim and Ko, 2012). Therefore, in context with present research, aims and objectives related to concept of reward system are given as below:-\nResearch Aim: “To determine how international brands impact on social attitude in fashion industry. A study on M&S”</p>\n<h2><strong>Research Objectives:</strong></h2>\n<li>To identify the effect of fashion industries on changing attitude of customers</li>\n<li>To ascertain the challenges faced by M&S due to changing behaviour of consumers in international retail market</li>\n<li>To determine strategies that need to be adopted by M&S to deal with challenges to stay competitive at fashion industry</li>\n<h2><strong>Research Questions:</strong></h2>\n<li>How to identify the effect of fashion industries on changing attitude of customers?</li>\n<li>What are the challenges faced by M&S due to changing behaviour of consumers in international retail market ?</li>\n<li>Which strategies are needed to be adopted by M&S to deal with challenges to stay competitive at fashion industry?</li>\n<h2><strong>1.3 Rationale of the research</strong></h2>\n<p>The recent entry of various fashion brands in international marketplace, decreases sales of existing organisation and create numerous challenges as well. It includes changing demand of customers, bargaining power of both suppliers and consumers, threats of entry of new competitor and more. All these challenges impact on profitability and sales performance of organisations dealing in fashion industry (Kamal, Chu and Pedram, 2013). The main purpose of conducting this research is to identify how international brands influences social attitudes in fashion industry. It entails changing behaviour of customers due to emergence of international organisation. In addition to this, it also describes strategies that M&S can use to deal with such challenges.</p>\n<h2>Chapter 2: Literature Review</h2>\n<h2><strong>2.1 Effect of fashion industries on changing attitude of customers</strong></h2>\n<p>As per article given by Kaisa Vehmas and et. al. (2019), it has identified that in fashion-industries, competition has become more intense. It is mainly increase due to fast-developing and affordable fashion which leads to change behaviour of customers also. People seek to get more trendy clothes and garments on reasonable rates to satisfy their needs. In addition to this, fast-fashion has become more popular as well as socially conscious movement, which shifts mindset of people from quantity to quality (Consumer attitude and communication in circular fashion, 2019). With emergence of organisations dealing in fashion industry, people concerns more on high-quality and fashionable trends of marketplace. In addition to this, as a result of fast fashion trend, customers are also discarding to higher volumes of textile waste. This would lead to reduce use of water, chemicals and energy in production of high quality of garments. Therefore, usage of wear and tear, non-removable stains turn textiles non-reusable. This type of products can be recycled or used as raw material.</p>\n<h2>2.2 Challenges faced by M&S due to changing behaviour of consumers</h2>\n<p>According to views and perception of Bertoli (2013), it has evaluated that changing behaviour of customers impact sustainability of organisations, in international market. As emergence of fashion industries at same marketplace impact hugely on perception and preference of customers. Therefore, it create various challenges for companies dealing in fashion industries. In context with M&S, getting a range of fashionable clothes on desired rates, move its targeted customers towards other organisations(Grayson and Hodges, 2017). So, this would lead to reduce customer base, decrease sales performance and more, which directly impacts on profitability and sustainability on business. It also arise issues related to attract new customers towards business as they want more trendy and fashionable clothes.</p>\n<h2><strong>2.3 Strategies to deal with challenges to stay competitive at fashion industry</strong></h2>\n<p>As per different perception and view points of Kim and et. al. (2012), it has analysed that to deal with challenges and changing behaviour of customers, M&S need to adopt effective strategies. It includes developing price strategies i.e. offer products on competitive price rates, promoting business through effective communication technologies etc. Therefore, to enhance sales performance, M&S should concern on adding more values in existing products. In addition to this, by using social media technology, it can develop effective relationship with national and international customers. This would help in getting their retention for longer period of time as well.</p>",

Further, Swedish designs and apparels are quite different to other country’s fashion companies and this also allows most of the brand to expand the business in other developed areas (Hauge, 2007). The present study has been made with an attempt to get insight about Swedish fashion and Swedish gender equality. However, Swedish gender equality is still a Utopian ideal for large parts of the world and Sweden has been highly emphasizing on such equality policies and strategies so that the overall interest of society members can be protected. Earlier, gender equality was one of the greatest challenge for Sweden to manage as women were considered as the least contributors in economic development. Many research studies also revealed that Sweden is the only country where women are provided with higher opportunities of employment and as per the research and interviews, it is also observed that women prefer to work more in Sweden due to equality and diversity. Aim: The main aim of the study is to find out if Sweden equality affects Sweden fashion. Objectives:</p>\n<li>To identify trends prevailing in fashion industry</li>\n<li>To ascertain the influence of gender equality on fashion industry of the UK</li>\n<li>To analyze the norms following in gender equality\nFurthermore the study has been using several tools and technologies in research methodology section so as to accomplish all the predefined objectives. Primary and secondary both the sources of data collection has been taken into account.\nLiterature Review\nSweden country greatly stands with aesthetics and the country is populous mainly amid those countries which encourages gender quality on a higher extent. The subsequent country largely considers gender equality in which males and females are provided with equal rights and responsibilities which further has a direct impact on fashion industry. Fashion industry of Sweden has been highly influenced by unisex apparels where same sort of casual and formal wear are produced for both males and females (Sweden’s New Gender-Neutral Pronoun: Hen, 2012). As per the views of Tokatli (2007), fashion trends keeps on changing as per the tastes and preferences of customers and this is also beneficial in terms of managing cost aspects for the industry. Most of the brands in Sweden and the UK likewise Acne, Rodbjer, Ann- Sofie Back produces same clothes for men and women such as unisex skinny jeans, shirts, t-shirts and shoes. Office going women have been wearing casual apparels such as trousers and shirts which are quite common between man and woman. Similarly, in the year 2000, the fashion industry of Sweden showed great increase which leads textile industry to become one of the largest exporters all around the world. Swedish fashion seems to be highly popular in other countries also due to brand expansion of H&M, COS and Cheap Monday. Out of all the innovative brands, Cheap Monday and Monki are the two chief brands that produces unisex clothes which perhaps also aids in managing operational costs in fashion industry. Swedish firm approaches the equality plan of action to ensure that both men and women get the same chances and rights in all the areas of life so, that their may be no scope of inequality among them (Sweden’s New Gender Neutral Pronoun Is a Step Towards Equality, and It’s Catching On Quickly, 2014). This gender equality has also affect the fashion industry. As, the the companies are manufacturing or designing the unisex clothes that can be wear by both men or women. Fashion has become the most coercive instrument in deposing the sexual identity through connotation of attire. Arnold (2008) suggested that choice of fashion keep changing with nation to nation as the market customers have different beliefs and values that depicts their fashion sense or attire (Arnold,  2008). With the contemporary changing market, female customers are free to choose the attire in which they feel comfortable. So, now a days women are quite comfortable and have adopted the jeans and pants in their regular life. Hence, Swedish fashion companies are more extrovert towards adopting the unisex apparels or clothing in their market as they initiated the gender equality in all the areas (Sweden Introduces New Gender-Neutral Pronoun, Makes Being a Man ILLEGAL, 2013). So, the gender equality differ from country to country fashion industry. According to the research it has been identified that in Sweden fashion industry has being manufacturing the wide range of unisex apparels for the women and men those are working in the company. As now a days it is common to wear the formal apparels at the workplace. Hence, the company designed the same formal shirts and trousers for men and women so that they can wear them at the workplace. Today’s apparels or accessories like shoes, watches are inspired by the gender equality. Contemporary fashion industry is facing the major environmental challenges as the Sweden fashion companies now a days focusing on producing and selling the unisex products for the market customers that can be wear by both men and women (Gender equality, economic growth and employment, n.d). As the Sweden highly focus on gender equality their famous fashion brands like Nudie and WeSC contribute significant role in designing the denim jeans that can be worn by anyone. The impact of gender equality on the fashion can be viewed by the attire of women working in the corporate industry. Taking masculine consideration the fashion industry develop the formal attire for women same like the men attire that is trouser and suits. According to Blau (1999) asserted that this concept producing the unisex accessories or apparels has increases the cross-gender imitations that disturb the society. As in the past their were separate attire for both women and men that look distinctive (Blau, 1999). For example, pants or trouser depicts the masculine power. But in the late 70s pants through out the worldwide were accepted as the female clothing. Hence, the gender equality within the Swedish fashion companies have negatively impact on their designed products (Gender equality is one of the greatest challenges of our time, 2014). While, Barnard (2007) suggested that gender equality in the fashion industry have given the path to the companies to manufacture the unisex clothing or accessories that can be wear by both men and women. This increases their profit margins as the designer clothes or accessories can be be adopted by both the sex (Barnard, 2007). Now a days men are also preferring the colors like pink and purple for their shirts or t-shirts, in past that is being used for portraying the feminine colors. The idea to create the unisex garment or apparels for both the sexes considered as the comfortable innovation and it also symbol as the equality between all the gender. While, the clothes like pants, trousers,  jeans etc are widely accepted by women in the world. According to Calefato (2004) unisex clothing intent to decrease the gender difference but gradually they has their opposite effects. The unisex movement have made the women apparels more masculine. As according to the research, Acne has launched the unisex garment collection. But even today it has been found that women mainly buys the unisex garments not men. In the male dominant countries they prefer to buy the clothes or apparels that suited on them and provides them masculine look (Calefato, 2004). The contemporary Sweden fashion industry have display the gender equality concept through their designer apparels and accessories. As the Cheap Mondays have introduced the concept of unisex skinny jeans for both the sexes that has introduced the huge revolution in the Sweden market. Whether male or female both prefer the same products hence it improve the society and also insure the equality between both of them (Gender Equality in the Swedish Welfare State, 2012). Hence, the Swedish gender equality  negatively effect the Swedish fashion. The new designer clothes or apparels produced by the Sweden companies do not distinct the masculine and feminine clothing.\nResearch Methodology\nResearch methodology is termed as the most significant part of the research which provides some tools and approaches for finding out the accessibility of research objectives and outcomes. The section is entirely integrated with aims and objectives: Research philosophy: Research philosophy is a clear and concise idea regarding the approaches and methods to be deployed in research. Apparently, this plays a significant role in increasing sustainability and effectiveness of the research methods. The section has been considered in the study since that draws clarity on specific research topic (John Wiley and SonsYin, 2009). The categories of research philosophy can be divided into two techniques such as positivism and interpretivism.  In the current study, the researcher has used positivism philosophy which aids in developing accurate and quantifiable results due to direct and accurate observations. It basically evaluates outcomes by using statistical methods. Data collection: While developing any study, it is required to grab data from diverse sources so that valid and accurate conclusions can be made. There are basically two techniques of data collection such as primary and secondary sources which aids researcher to collect data. In the present case, the researcher has used primary technique in which customers between the age of 20-40 years are selected and they are provided with questionnaire which is made up of different aspects related to fashion and equality aspects in Sweden (Kuada, 2012). This is particularly beneficial in terms of collecting fresh hand information from the respondents. On contrary to this, secondary sources are also used in which online articles, books and journals are reviewed which is further used for literature review section. Sampling: Researcher has selected appropriate customers for sampling in which people between the age of 20 – 40 years are provided with questionnaire. Thus, sampling has been done through random sampling in which no specific area is taken. Research approaches: Research approach is very much helpful in enhancing the efficacy of research and it also clarifies the usefulness of study and research topic. This is mainly categorized into two types such as deductive and inductive. Deductive approach uses theoretical and conceptual structure so that accurate results can be found out through observations (Levy and Lemeshow, 2013). This also moves from general to specific inferences. Deductive approach is also taken because it consumes less time and certainly, it produces germane and relevant conclusion. Research design: Research designing is a crucial section of research report which helps researcher to take significant decisions regarding conducting the study. This choice holds imperative value as the manner in which the pertinent data will be collected is determined by the research design. The chief categories of research design are case study, descriptive and exploratory. In the present study, the researcher has taken exploratory research design to provide comprehensive analysis in a particular situation (Sreedharan, 2007). Furthermore, it is also useful in terms of augmenting  the familiarity of researcher with that to research aspects. The design is also flexible in nature which helped the researcher to define research outcomes in suitable manner. Data analysis: The section of data analysis represents views and opinions of respondents regarding present topic. In order to analyze data, researcher has selected quantitative method in which charts and tables are made for repression data into numerical order. At the same time, researcher has also developed several themes so as to specify the main outcomes of research study. This has helped the study to specify all the actions and courses which are integrated with research aims and objectives (Stake, 2005). Only specified aspects have been taken into account so that better outcomes can be presented for the study. Apart from this, the other technique of data analysis is not used in the present study. Data analysis section holds true importance in research project since through that responses can be presented in suitable manner. Ethical considerations: One of the main aspects which researcher has to consider while developing study is to analyze different ethical aspects. Researcher has also considered ethical aspects likewise investigation took place with germane and ethical sources so that valid conclusions can be made. The researcher also took only responses of only those candidates who have presented feasible results and outcomes. However the main issue raised here is that some sources are quite irrelevant and researcher also faced constraints in identifying suitable sources (Tracy, 2012). Some of the participants did not give any sort of response towards the study which also lacks credibility and reliability.</li>",

          "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Critical analysis of intersectional representational of gender and race\nThe selected article is about Race, gender, class and intersectionality (Bhandar. B 2013). This article is selected because it help in exploring the key debate related to intersectionality on race and gender. It has been noted by one of the speaker that the way organised left contingents at recent anti- fascist demos against the English defence league. Further there are most of the while people in British national party and this was need to be cultivated an anti- racist politics on the left which include people of race. Black women always knowns as the hard-working women and but they were not paid for their worth. It has been suggested that one of the main reason for this absence is known as the perception among different people of colour (Weigand, Webb and Mills, 2016.). This one of is left because socialist organisation and parties have had, and regularly not have good record of taking issues in to consideration seriously of gender and race. If race should be taken seriously then it required more than one mentioning the word that is anti- racism and it also declare that racism take place.\nConceptual framework\nThe gender and race inequality take place but some people still not believe on gender and race inequality. But it is a big role in students education in all over the world. It has been observed that black people were not treated equally in politics and racism and sexism is still now alive all over the world. The present report reflects the way to stop the gender and race inequality in the politics and workplace at different levels (Sanchez-Peña, Main and McGee, 2016,). Women are always fundamentally different from the men it is so because of their ability to bear children. There are several root cause of gender inequality and the way this all issues faced by women at same time. Further it has been discovered that gender inequalities is central to societies for centuries and the race is known as the modern idea. Some of people believe that group of people who are similar physiological characteristics constitute races. However the race is a system which is imposed by the political, cultural and historical. Hence it can be stated that a black and while person can be have more in common that two people of the same race. Apart from this black women are not paid fairly and according to their work (Elhuni, Wilcox and Merritt, 2016.). They also experience poverty at higher rates as compared to black men and women who belong to other ethnic and racial.\nRepresenting inequality\nThis article show inequality which is done with the black women at the work place, in politics and societies. Black women were not treated as equal as other racism within the societies and work place. Further it has been noted that black women’s relationship to both paid labour and unpaid work in home is importantly contrary as compared to men. It is contrary developed and equally essential theme which concerns the way black women unpaid family is at the same time confining and appoint black women (Herron and Rosenberg, 2016.). Further it was found that the home and domestic work is knowns as the key sites of women relationship. This above discussion show that inequality is not justifiable. However it show the way in ignoring the ways through which women of colour have out of demand integrated their claims for equality, redistribution and recognition. It means that it is not possible to separates all of these out analytically and practically at the time when sexism and racism is ready to constitute the specific form of class exploitation which is faced and experienced. Further black women are critiqued modes of analysis which fail to consider the way gender and race cannot be kept analytically different if one understand the persecution operated along these axes as in the interlinking manner. Black women are continuously working for a better their nation, but nation are not working for them. If black women’s experience and interest in the forefront of policy changes and social movements then it is easy to address all the barrier (Gross, Gottburgsen and Phoenix, 2016.). One of the other example, which is taken of an group who are incorporated and analysis of race and gender into her work. Author argued that the making of the working class is only possible by the help of capitalist system which is committed to both racism and sexism. From the process of divisions and differences with the working class which is built on the basis of gender and race became constitutive of class rule and the planning of modern working class (Sapon-Shevin, Brimhall-Vargas and Nieto, 2017).\nDifferent, otherness and superiority\nTo build a basic left political movement or network which means to take gender and racism inequality seriously. Further there is a great instances of solidarity and activism betwixt left a particular campaign and left organisation. In a different context the attempt of the organisers of the historical materialism meeting to report for race and gender which is showed in the stream being organised on race (Mandel and Semyonov, 2016.). The Black radical tradition and Marxist legacies of anti racism is taken into consideration for black women’s rightist policy and critical indigenous theory were remain one of the big hindrance on which advance being made on this front . For instances of socialist feminist work which was failed. Further all its problems related to the racism and gender is one of the core part of its analysis. The organiser not think that feminism not think that it is essential to include women of different colour or scholars who basically deals with both race and gender (Chmielewski, Fine and Stoudt, 2016.). Superiority\nDifferent ways due to which women are neglected because of their colour have out necessity integrated their claims for equality and redistribution. Therefore it is not easy to separate on the basis of colour because racism and discrimination is always ready to constitute the specific form of class exploitation which one is faced with it (Chmielewski, Belmonte and Stoudt, 2016.). One of the reason of failure of this approach is that universalise the experience of middle class women, white and other . Hence it means that experience of black women, and indigenous women and Asian women are removed by the politics of left and theories feminisms. It means that all the problem which is analysed of political are not correct. It is so because capitalism was imitative through complex legal ouster, and third world labour whose value stay fixed at the some degree by racism and a continual belief in white superiority.\nDifferentiation is still done between people in context to the race and gender. There are many black women who work hard for their family but they do not get fair pay for their work (Weigand, Webb and Mills, 2016). Further there are some theory which help in removing inequality which take place at different sector of that is organisation, education and others.\nOverarching message of the piece\nFrom the article it reflects that some of the criticism are intersectionality and take place in the liberal anti racism purposes. Further, the main reason of this absence is the thinking of people related to colour due to which socialist parties need to continued it a poor tracking take place so that record taking issues of race and racism seriously (Sanchez-Peña, Main and McGee, 2016). For taking the anti discrimination more seriously it is important to gather some knowledge about it and find out the analyse problems . Further, it is critically assessed that an identity based politics of recognition which lead to create inequality among the people . The intersectionality have long emphasized that the comparison is made between women on the basis of their race and ethnicity.\nLink back to theoretical debater and conclusion\nFrom the above report it can be concluded that Black women are always knowns as the hard working women and they did not get pay according to their work. This show that women are always discriminated at each field . Further it also conclude that rethink the concepts which is used at the time when it required to explain the political event. It is not important to only know about the anti racism. It is required to think about the security which is needed so that discrimination can be removed from all over the world. Issues related to income inequality need to be taken into consideration so that men and women not treated unequally. From the report it show that racism and gender discrimination is not removed from all over the world. There are some theories which help in understanding and removing this type of discrimination so that all people can be treated fairly.\nReferences</p>\n<li>Weigand, H., Webb, S. R., and Mills, J.

          "<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Queer refers to those communities that are physically different from other general public and those mindsets and preferences also differ in great extent. Legalisation of Homosexuality has been debated since its very inception and there are people who are for and as well as against same-sex marriage (Cornwall and Lindisfarne, 2016). The following report is on understanding this debate in Australia by undertaking queer analysis. It covers the biological and social factors regarding queer as well as positive and negative factors of same-sex marriage that helps in gaining a wider understanding of this community as well as homosexual marriages.\nASK 1\nWhat could a queer analysis bring to an understanding of the debates about same-sex marriage in Australia?\nQueer, traditionally used as a term for homosexuality, now refers to both 4,444 people attracted to individuals of the same sex and those whose bodies and gender do not correspond to dominant societal norms. This term unambiguously explores disagreements between anatomical gender, gender identity, and sexual desire. The debate over same-sex marriage in Australia is quite old. This debate arose against 4,444 political agendas. Even after this debate has received 4,444 different opinions from the community and politics, it remains controversial and complicated in 4,444 countries. Queer analysis can be clearly understood by queer theory, to which gives the idea of '​​variety theory', a term which implements the promotion of heterosexuality as a normal sexual orientation. Regarding the 4,444-person same-sex marriage debate, the Howard government in 2004 limited marriage between 4,444 women and one man. However, in 2017, the Australian government passed Bill on same-sex marriages. The arguments presented were quite specific to both sides of the controversy . While the minority referred to the Catholic religion, where marriage is limited to men and women, the majority argues for equality accorded to individuals over their marriage (Vivar, 2016). However, gay analysis can be a relevant source for understanding the gay debate. According to analysis, has many views linking this aspect with many other concepts such as biology and society. Biologically, the analysis focused on an atypical combination of the X and Y chromosomes that were natural enough for them to differ and exhibit contrasting sex characteristics. As far as the social concept is concerned, analysis makes it possible to understand the behavior of individuals. According to various theories, an individual's personal identity is not born of him but is built through repeated practice. When it comes to homosexuality, 4344 of their sexual tastes and preferences depend on their identity. For the Australian debate, it is quite important that these two aspects are understood by individuals against same-sex marriage and that it should be seen as the union of two individuals and not just one. man and a woman. An understanding of the biology of these individuals is needed to better understand their behavior. Such an understanding will allow them to move beyond cultural and social norms and allow them to accept such marriages as a natural activity. In addition, the right of choice must be granted to all Australian citizens as the government will give them supremacy to choose the partner they wish to marry. In addition, discrimination against 4,444 homosexuals must end and appropriate sex education should be provided to children and 4,444 youth to promote equality and a better understanding of the concept of homosexuality. (Wodak and Benke, 2017). The debate even after its legalization continues in countries. Queer analysis has also helped individuals and communities have a broader view of the areas that will be affected after same-sex marriage. A report by the Family Research Council focuses on some of the things that make this debate far from over. The most important factor focused on by Council was the children. Same-sex couples use methods such as surrogacy and Invitro (IVF) to conceive children. However, these methods kept these children away from their biological parents. In this way, same-sex marriage often has 4,444 detrimental effects on children as they are forced to be separated from their parents and often not introduced, making the situation worse (Buikema, Plate & Thiele, 2017). Second, each parent has an important role to play in the lives of their children. Homosexuality abolishes this desire for satisfaction in children, which causes psychosis in their mind. On top of that, there have been quite a few reported cases showing that children raised by same-sex couples can suffer from gender and sexual dysfunction. This evidence became even stronger when we analyzed how children raised by same-sex couples ended up in same-sex relationships. It further eliminates the right to choose due to the uneven rate of sex regulation due to having same-sex parents. Third, the main concern of same-sex marriage is sexual fidelity between couples. Silence Recently, research on civil unions has provided evidence of the fact that nearly 79 percent of people value sexual fidelity compared to just 50 percent of same-sex couples. The need for extramarital relations in same-sex couples is much greater than in heterosexuals. This factor again voted against same-sex marriage (Ten Arguments from Social Science Against SameSex Marriage, 2019). With such strong influencing factors working against same-sex marriage, there is also evidence to suggest that covered by same-sex analysis show benefits associated with same-sex marriage . The first benefit is to protect your spouse's legal rights. Legalizing same-sex marriage brings many benefits to couples in terms of finances, taxes and medical services. They are entitled to all sums of money as well as legal benefits as a heterosexual couple, which gives them psychological satisfaction when legally accepted. The legalization of same-sex marriages also has an impact on the stigma and discrimination against same-sex individuals as well as on society, these marriages are also accepted by the state, which makes them equally important to individuals. than any other type of marriage. Queer analysis also clearly shows how much of a positive effect same-sex marriage has on children. Legalizing these 4,444 marriages will help same-sex couples practice\nConclusion\nTherefore, it can be concluded that same-sex analysis is urgent enough for a deeper understanding of same-sex marriages. Biological and social factors related to the same-sex community can indeed help other people understand the behavior and preferences of the same-sex community . Queer analysis also helps better understand the positive and negative factors of same-sex marriage that have an impact on the community and the nation as a whole. However, individuals and governments can consider the positive effects of same-sex marriage and should give individuals the freedom to choose, inform and educate others to reduce the risk of discrimination and promote equal treatment.\nReferences</p>\n<li>Blumenfeld, W.J., 2017.

          "<li><strong>Care Plan That Promotes Positive Health Outcomes</strong></li>\n<li>In order to promote positive health status for Michelle Bell, it is essential for the registered nurse to provide suitable medication and treatment to the patient. In the present case, Michelle had breathlessness and nausea and she also had mild tachycardia (Watanabe and et.al., 2016).</li>\n</li>\n<li>Hence, she feel unwell and most often her pulse reaches to 160bpm. She do not engage herself in exercise and she does not care about her diet as well.</li>\n<li>Therefore, looking towards this aspect, it is crucial for the registered nurse to develop a diet plan so that Michelle could consume healthy diet.</li>\n<li>At the same time, it is also recommended to her to stop drinking regularly because that is also affecting her heart condition (O’Driscoll and et.al., 2016).\nPathology And Pathophysiology Of The Health State Of The Patient\n</li>\n<li>As, Michelle Bell is having tachycardia, her heart beats too fast and it also do not pump blood effectively to rest of the body. This deprives the other organs and tissues of oxygen and as a result it causes shortness of breath. Pulse rate of Michelle is rapid due to tachycardia; hence because of all these factors, she has irregular heartbeat. When Michelle is admitted to the hospital, it was analysed that her BP is 165/90 mmHg (O’Flynn, McLaughlin and Keatings, 2016). This caused breathlessness to her and consequently she turned pale. Tachycardia is caused by something that disrupts the normal electrical impulse which controls the rate of heart’s pumping action. There are various things that contribute to this problem such as anaemia, exercise, high or low blood pressure, drinking too many caffeinated beverages and abuse of alcohol. Hence, it can be said that all these things have caused major changes in Michelle Bell’s health (Monro-Somerville and et.al., 2016).\nAnalyse And Reflect Skill Performance\nStrengths and weaknesses\nIn the present case, I played the role of registered nurse in casualty department of the hospital and I made care plan for Michelle Bell. According to my job roles, I could say that I had played all my responsibilities in effective manner. I made certain changes in her diet so that she could take healthy food (Cronin and et.al., 2016). This is essential for her as most of the time she gets food from outside and as a result, she is having various health issues. However, I have faced several challenges as well due to Michelle’s regular drinking habit. Since, she drinks most days, so the medication did not show me that outcome which I expected.\nDemonstrate commitment to professional learning and patient outcome\nIn terms of improvement, I will adopt certain things so that I can manage my capability to contribute more efforts in enhancing my practice. I will make sure that I always prepare care plan on the basis of accessing the medical history of the patient. Further, all the professional standards will be maintained while delivering care services to the patients (Cronin and et.al., 2016). For future cases, I will ensure that I am considering all the aspects of the patients so that better and prominent services could be delivered.\nReferences </li>\n<li>Cronin, A. M. and et.al., 2016.

        peragraph: `<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Fall prevention can be determined as a situation or an action to reduce the number of accidents that are face by older people due to falls. The injury that is caused due to falls and fall are the most common and serious medical problems that are faced by older adults (Granacher, Gollhofer and Muehlbauer, 2013). When a person is facing serious health issues and when a fall occurs, then the condition becomes worse. As per the data, it can be stated that about 1/3 of the people every year fall and half of them fall twice. This type of issues occur because of decreased reflexes and mobility and underlying osteoporosis. Results of fall causes fractures, head injury and most of the cases even death. This research will cover different type of secondary research done on this topic.\nBackground of Study\nThere are different type of research done on fall prevention. This study will enable to provide proper information about the issues and strategies that are implemented by health and social care so that they will be able to reduce its impact and older people can be provided with better services (DiBardino, Cohen and Didwania, 2012). In this context, below given are five researches that are done on fall prevention:</p>\n <table>

    </table>\n<p>As per the articles that has been done about, in the first article, it has been found that in hospitals there are conditions in which patients fall per 1000 patients days in targeted units during the period of study (Dykes Carroll and et.al., 2010). When compared with the other articles there are no research that has been done in this area. This shows that there are accidents that take place in the hospitals and it is important that professional take appropriate steps to reduce the impact. Healthcare professionals should be given with fall prevention tool kit so that accidents of fall can be reduced.\nIn the finding, it can be stated that there are different type of programmes or strategies that are implemented in order to reduce fall. The second article talks about exercise programmes in order to reduce injury in community (El-Khoury, Cassou and et.al., 2013). Both article 1 and article 2 are similar but the strategies that are used is different. Further, there are about 4305 participants involved and all were taken above the age of 60. In addition to this, 17 trials were conducted. All these analyses were helpful enough to come up with appropriate solution that exercise programmes were helpful.\nIn article 3 there are no participants taken as all the article is based on different secondary research that has already been done by different researchers. This article is helpful to know the main causes due to which fall occur (Annweiler, Montero-Odasso and et.al., 2010). This is generally after the age of 60 when eyes, bones and muscles gets weaker. In such situation, one of the major element that are helpful is Vitamin D which is important in the body so as to make sure that the fall can be reduced and this is been done by providing proper diet.\nArticle 1, 2 and 4 are similar as they all talk about different strategies which can be implemented with the help of which falls can be reduced. In this article, researcher talks about inpatient fall prevention program in which professional will make sure that all they all precaution is taken and they are provided with proper safety is provided to them so that they will be able to make sure that falls can be reduced and older people can provided with proper safety (Miake-Lye, Hempel and et.al., 2013). Further, this study includes 4 meta analyse and 19 studies involved which makes this study more reliable and effective.\nIn article 5, researcher talks about providing professional or seniors with proper training so that they will be able to make sure that they provide safe services to old people. This article is different from other researches (Bridenbaugh and Kressig, 2010). When compared with all the other research this research is done over the professionals and rest others are done over old people or patients who are above the age of 60 years.\nFindings\nAs per the findings that has been identified from the essay is that mostly all except for one make use of qualitative research. Further, it can be determined that there are different set of strategies and programs that can be used in order to reduce or eliminate the causes of fall (Pynoos Steinman and Nguyen, 2010). Moreover, the fall issues are less to young people and even if they fall their body have that strength to recover the damage caused. On the other hand, old age people, if they fall then it may cause them serious issues and in most of the cases there are also chances of death.\nConclusion\nFrom this finding, it can be articulated that implementation of fall prevention programmes are highly beneficial and they play vital role in reducing he impacts of fall (DiBardino, Cohen and Didwania, 2012). Most of the drops occur due to medical conditions that are faced by old people. The treatments to falls is highly expensive when compared with other issues that are caused. Fall can be reduced at great extent when the programs are implemented or applied effectively and efficiently.\nReferences</p>\n<li>Annweiler, C., Montero-Odasso, M. and et.al., 2010.

It can be argued that efficient services must be provided to consumers. & Nbsp; Tourism & nbsp; and the hospitality industry in Australia is growing at a faster pace and offers tremendous opportunities for success and growth. The health and well-being of employees must be assured so that can ensure the growth and success of the organization. The aim of this report is to critically analyze the different stressors faced by individuals working in the hospitality industry. The report presents a description of the impact of these stressors on the turnover rate of the unit's 4,444 employees. In addition, strategies that companies can use to reduce stress at work are also covered..\nFindings 1 :-\nStressors facing the hospitality industry: & nbsp; According to studies conducted by O'Neill and Davis, (2011) observed that there were affirming that the health and well-being of individuals should be ensured in the hospitality industry . Satisfied employees show a positive contribution in achieving the desired business goals. In the mentioned study, the two most important stressors were interpersonal stress at work and overload. A significant stressor is the interpersonal tension that exists between employees and, as a result, the likelihood of workplace conflicts and problems increases. It is essential that maintains good coordination among employees in order for to carry out its business functions effectively..\nIn addition to discrimination against employees on the basis of gender and marital status is another important factor influencing employee stress levels . Lack of an appropriate action plan to distribute tasks and the 4,444 responsibilities between employees was also an important factor supporting the high stress levels of 4,444 employees. If an appropriate and top-notch working environment is not provided for employees, it will lead to negative creative effects on 4,444 employees and increased mental stress levels of employees as a result. . Another stressor for 4,444 employees is the lack of a reasonable salary and compensation policy due to the inability to meet the basic needs of 4,444 employees. In the hospitality industry, meeting the needs and expectations of 4,444 consumers is important to ensure positive growth and profitability of 4,444 units. If employees do not complete their work and responsibilities on time, stress will increase. These are some of the important stressors faced by personnel working in the hospitality industry . The study results were observed that there was no significant difference in employee stress levels due to gender difference. is also mentioned in the study that employees who report higher work frequency report lower job satisfaction and higher intention to change business and interpersonal stress close an important role in improving the employee turnover rate in the unit. Finally, concluded that managers and employees may experience more stress because have to delegate more responsibilities to them. The study concluded that there is a relationship between negative physical health symptoms and stress. According to the Australian Tourism Workforce Report 2015-2020, the ratio of 4,444 employees in hotels is increasing. According to research done by Meloury and Signal, (2014) It has been observed that aggression in the food industry is a lifelong problem and it occurs due to physical, psychological and environmental needs associated with Culture.\nFindings 2\nStrategies for reducing these stressors\nAccording to the research done by Deery (2008), it was observed that long working hours outside of society, low skills, low means are important factors leading to the creation of work-related stress. jobs for members of the hotel industry. According to study , several strategies can be adopted to reduce employee turnover and employee stress including recruiting strategies and developing work-life balance policies . In addition, in Study it was mentioned that the quality of training could be improved and appropriate and job-appropriate education could be provided to the employees. Can staffing properly and can allow breaks during the workday.\nHealth and well being opportunities can be provided to the staff members and rewards can be given for performing their job in effective way. As per the study conducted by Zhao and Ghiselli, (2016) it has been suggested that hospitality organizations should restructure the work environment for reducing work related stress among staff members. Work schedules can be rearranged so that interference in the personal life of staff members can be avoided. It has been mentioned in the study conducted by Chiang, Birtch, and Kwan, (2010) That availability of work life practices, low job control and high job demands results in high level of stress among staff members in hotel industry. Effective work life balance policies can be formed in the entity for reducing the job stress from the employees and providing them better and conductive work environment. It has been found from the study conducted by Roan and Diamond, (2003) that flexible working hours can be provided to the staff members for reducing the overload. It has been mentioned in the study that career promotions, and career development opportunities can be rendered to staff members for enhancing their motivational level and overall productivity.\nDiscussions\nThe stressors identified in the results were also associated with employees working in a small and medium-sized hotel on the Gold Coast. Interpersonal tension exists among employees and it has been observed that the employees in the hotel are overloaded with jobs. Gold Coast hotels are facing a problem due to the high employee turnover rate of and the overall productivity and growth of the company being affected. It is essential that effective action is taken to address the problem facing the business. It is essential that deadlines for each task be met for to meet customer expectations and provide better service to consumers. Personal tension among employees is the main reason for the high turnover rate of employees in the company. Overcrowding is a stressor more specific to men than women.\nEmployees find it difficult to reconcile HR and professional life and are faced with more family interventions. The strategies identified in the research, such as implementing work-life balance policies, recruiting strategies , work planning and restructuring the work environment , have been effective in solving Problems Resolving issues encountered in hotels located on the Gold Coast. The strategy that is most useful to an organization is to develop a work-life balance policy. These are the most effective strategies that will help motivate employees towards their work and employee retention will be achieved by adopting this strategy. Strategy Comprehensive restructuring is the least effective strategy because it requires a huge investment from the top management and it will take a long time for to achieve positive results when implementing the strategy.\nConclusion\nIt has been concluded that Interpersonal tension and overload are two most crucial stressors due to which employee turnover rate is high in the Hotel. Work life balance policies and scheduling of work and tasks can be done for resolving the issue faced by the entity and enhancing productivity of employees.\nRecommendations\nHotel situated at Gold Coat is facing problem due to the high staff turnover rate of the employees. Work place stress can be reduced and profitability can be maintained by adopting following methods –</p>\n<li>Work life Balance policies can be formulated and involvement of staff members should be taken for making effective policies. Flexible working hours can be provided to personals working in hotel and options of job sharing and working from home can be given for reducing the overload.</li>\n<ol><li>Work life Balance policies can be formulated and involvement of staff members should be taken for making effective policies.

        peragraph: `<h2>Introduction to Women’s Language</h2>\n<p>Different research studies have concluded that men and women use language differently. As per the widespread belief “women talks more as compare to the men” (Hall and Bucholtz, 2012). But, most of the vresear4ch studies have found contradict findings about this beliefs. Along with this, different genders discuss distinct topics such as men tend to talk about sports, politics and cars but on the other hand women tend to discuss about child care and personal relationships, etc. Most of the recent work in sociolinguistic has focused upon the variation in conversational styles of men and women (Hellinger and Motschenbacher, 2015). The current essay is also focus on features of different language and their use by women and men. Along with this, it also focuses on impact on use of these features and its impact on confidence and tentativeness.Therefore, major objective of this essay is to assess the claim that women do in fact these such features more frequently than men and these features index lack of confidence and nervousness (Gay, Hicks, Santacreu-Vasut and Shoham, 2015).\nEssay will focus on the statement of Robin Lakoff in which she focused on gender differences to syntax, semantic and style. In her research study she identified that women used number of linguistic features which she claimed were used more often by women as compare to men and which shows the expressed uncertainty, lack of confidence and nervousness (Ervin-Tripp, 2014). Essay will focus on different ways by which language is used and linguistic attitude. Further, it also shed lights on association between languages, culture and thoughts. Including this, issue of the women’s language is also considered as major part of this report which will help in understanding the major concepts of this essay. In addition, focus will also be given on use of distinct styles of language used by women. Research will find out that weather there is any difference in the way by which women and men make interactions with others. Therefore, the whole essay will focus on women’s language (De Fina and King, 2011).</p>\n<h2>Features of women’s language</h2><li>PRobin lakoff has identified ten elements of women’s language which are frequently used by women during their conversations (Women’s Language, 2015). All these features shows the language attitude of women these features are described as under:</li>\n<li>Hedging: Women use this feature at the timer of conversation which shows the uncertainty and lack of authority. For example, sort of, kind of and I guess, etc (Cook, 2011).</li>\n<li>Politeness: Women generally use super polite words and forms such as would you please and I would really appreciate it if, etc.</li>\n<li>Tag questions: In women’s language, tag questions added to the end of the statement and do not change the statement (Kunsmann, 2013). For example, you would do that, wouldn’t you?</li>\n<li>Emotional emphasis: Women use emotional content and tone that emphasizes on emotions. For example, you are so very kind and I am so grateful to you (Linn, 2014).</li>\n<li>Empty adjectives: Adding a friendly element in the sentence shows the use of empty adjectives in conversation. Although women do not use any meaningful content at the time of conversation.</li>\n<li>Correct grammar and pronunciation: Women expect hypercorrect grammar and pronunciation at the time of discussion and conversation. They use sales less as compare to men (Erickson, Lind, Johnson and O’Barr, 1978). For example, I would be very appreciate if you could show me the way of my destination.</li>\n<li>Lack of humor: women do not use humor and funny words at the time of discussion. So lack of humor is also one of the major feature of women’s language. So, women are poor in telling jokes.</li>\n<li>Direct quotations: Women generally quoted word which have said by others for example, Rita said that he said, “I won’t to do it. ‘So I said, Why Not?” (Larson, Johnson and Haselton, 2012).</li>\n<li>Extended vocabulary: Generally, women use extended vocabulary rather than simple language. For example, the wall should be cerise neon pink tracer. So, use of extra vocabulary is also considered as major feature of women’s language.</li>\n<li>Declarations with interrogative intonation: Generally statement are used by women for asking questions by intonating question mark at the end of the statement (Berger, 2013). For example, that sounds like a good thing to do?\nOverall, different features of women’s language has reflected that generally women use different words for different purpose as compare to the men which make different meaning for others. These meanings are difficult to understand by others.  They use some words which shows disagreement and lack of authenticity. Along with this, they use different words with extra politeness and emotions (Baxter, 2012). Women focuses on correct grammar and pronunciation and extended vocabulary.\n</li>\n<h2>Sociolinguistics history</h2>\n<li>Sociolinguistics can be defined as a descriptive study which shows the effects of different aspects of society such as cultural norms, expectations and context on the way of language used. Along with this, it also helps in determining the effects of language used on society (Guillaume, 2014). It also focuses on the use of different language between distinct groups because of various ethnicity, religion, status and gender and income, etc. Some research studies also focuses on the gender in sociolinguistics in which study shows the use of language by different gender. Effects arise on use of language because of the belongingness of the person with different class, social language, restricted codes, culture and beliefs, etc (O’barr, 2014).\nHistory of Sociolinguistics has disclosed that “social determinants has strong association with different language which increases variations for linguistic theory”. In contrast, some of research study has also disclosed some factors about the international; sociolinguistics. Along with this, background research studies have concluded that language is one of the major tool of communication which can be influenced by the place, speaking, people, condition and situation (Elmes, 2013). Place is very important factor because generally it shows the style of language which have used by different people. Including this, sociolinguistics has reflected that gender and sexual identity also affect the use of language because of the culture and society. Overall, sociolinguistics shows the effects of different elements on use of language by different gender men and women (Gay, Hicks, Santacreu-Vasut and Shoham, 2015).</li>\n<h2>Different ways by which language is used</h2>\n<p>Language works as vehicle for the transmission of cultural knowledge and gain access to the contents of others’ minds. It provides opportunity to human being to express their attitude change, social perception, personal identity, attribution, and so on. In most of the cases, language involves exchanges of representations of personal feeling in front of others. On the basis of speech practices associated with gender, specific gender roles that are prescribed by society and language used by women can be explored. Communicative behavior of men and women differ in terms of effective use of paralinguistic features such as ‘mhm’ and ‘yeah’. Women generally use them most frequently as compared to men. In order to display active listening and interest, women are mostly used streams of talk”, such as “mm” or “yeah”. Sometimes, these meanings are difficult to understand by other.  In the context of using questions in conversations, men and women perception are also differed. In addition, it is identified that women use questions more frequently as compared to men. Besides that, female linguistic behaviour characteristically indicates the interest of women to take turns in conversation with others (Krauss and Chiu, 2011). Despite of that, differences between the speech of women and men can be identified in terms of particles that grammarians often described. It can be understood with help of example. Lakoff (1973) taken an example to differentiate between language used by men and women. Researcher used to sentences including (a) “Oh dear, you’ve put the peanut butter in the refrigerator again” and (b) Shit, you’ve put the peanut butter in the refrigerator again to understand difference between sentences and language used by gender.  On the basis of above example, it can be predicted that (a) sentence is women’s language and another one is men language. It is found that men’s language is increasingly being used by women. But on the other hand, due to American masculine image (e.g. homosexuals), women’s language is not being adopted by men.\nOn the other side, on the basis of ‘stronger’ and ‘weaker’ expletives, language used by men and women can be differentiated. For example, ‘shit’, ‘oh dear’, or ‘goodness’ words are saying with feeling. These words represent strength of an emotion conveyed in a sentence. While some words and sentences used by women such as ‘trivializing’ and Oh fudge, my hair is on fire are meaningless and highly inappropriate. It is found that trait, society’s expectations, merely mirroring and nonlinguistic differences are responsible for creating language difference. In addition, Women generally quoted word which have said by others for example, Rita said that he said, “I won’t to do it. ‘So I said, Why Not?,” It create negative impact on listener and persons by whom women is interacting. The above example shows reinforces men’s position of strength in the real world in term of expressing opinion and share their thoughts in a meaning sense. In addition, linguistic reasons and an examination of language are the other major factors which are responsible for women denied equality partially. From the critical comparison between sentence and language used by women and men, it is clear that woman may freely use the neutral words without any risk (Talbot, 2010). For example, feminine an advertising executive use express her idea with other by using different expression such as raised eyebrow and giving reaction using “mm” or “yeah sentences.</p>\n<h2>Linguistic attitude</h2>\n<p>Linguistic can be defined as a scientific study of language and it has three different aspects which are language form, language meaning and language in context. Linguistic attitude can also be defined as feelings of people about their own language and variety of other languages of other people. There are some basic assumptions about the language attitude which have disclosed by historical research studies (Language Attitudes, 2015). These are described as under:</p>\n<li>Women talk too much.</li>\n<li>Children cannot speak or write properly any more.</li>\n<li>Black children are verbally deprived.\nAll these assumptions help in understanding behavior of individuals. Analysis of the language attitude helps in determining the emotions of women. Attitude of linguistic can be affected by the different factors of society such as culture, thought and beliefs, etc. Along with this, attitude shows that traits of speaker or women such as height, looks, intelligent, dependability, leadership, sociability and character, etc (The Domain of Linguistics: An Overview, 2015). Attitude of women can be determined by analyzing their grammar, vocabulary and sentence framing ways. Including this, different ways of using language also help in determining the attitude of women at the time of conversation.</li>\n<h2>Association between languages, culture and thoughts</h2>\n<p>Language is one of the important elements of culture which help in understanding the human life (Erickson, Lind, Johnson and O’Barr, 1978). Women use this element in different manner which is very difficult to understand by men. Different research studies have concluded that language and culture are interrelated. Verbal expressions of individuals help in analyzing the culture of them. Along with this, language plays important role in conveying culture, norms, values and beliefs among others. Some articles has denoted that culture hiding languages. Women uses language as a primary weapon of communication. It helps in reflecting their personality and culture (The Relationship between Language and Culture, 2010). But sometimes due to the powerful and powerless language of women it is very difficult to get relationship between culture, thought and language of women.</p>\n<h2>Issue of the women’s language</h2>\n<p>As per the research study of Robin, women’s language is associated with the different issues such as uncertainty, politeness, lack of confidence and tentativeness, etc. As per the result of Gender and interaction theory, it is clear that interest, wants, needs and goods are the major causes affect language used by women to communicate with men. In addition, female pattern of speech, less standard use of forms of English, responsibility to initiate conversations and vast majority of questions asked by women are the major issues associated with the language by women during interaction. Despite of that, Cross linguistic examination explored that grammar, use of vocabulary, convey negative attitudes and personal use of pronouns are the other major weakness which are responsible for creating language issue for women in society (Lakoff, 2009).  In addition, linguistic reasons, emotions, use of adjectives such as adorable, charming, divine and so on are the other problems associated with language used by women in their interaction. Despite of that, women movement made sexism in language occurs as political issue and reflects their point of view. It may be occurred due to several reasons such as asymmetric between pairs of genders differentiated term, generic sense, negative connotations and change the meaning of original word are the other major issues which are attached with the language used by women during personal communication and interaction with each other (Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2013). All these issues are described as under:\nUncertainty: This is the major issue of the women’s language which occur due to the different ways and styles of language use. Sometimes, women uses different hedge which shows uncertainty and lack of authority (Feminist Philosophy of Language, 2010). These words are used by women in case of uncertain knowledge on some basic subject. Sometimes, it shows error in making communication with others. Therefore, uncertainty is one of the major issues of the women’s language. For example, women use this sentence “Well, I sort of looked at him, and then he kind of looked back. Then I guess I kept looking”. This sentence shows the uncertain knowledge of women as well as it also shows disagreement with non-absolute language (Larson, Johnson and Haselton, 2012).\nPoliteness: As per the above analysis of the women’s language, female personality use huge polite words at the time of making discussion and conversation with other people. For example, do excuse me, but I really appreciate it if you could take a little time to help me. This statement shows the extra politeness of women. Sometimes it creates problem for other persons at the time of communication (De Fina and King, 2011).\nLack of confidence: women’s language is less forcefully as compare to men because men use bad language which creates force on other persons. So, less forcefulness of language shows the lack of confidence among women. Along with this, women asks lots of questions which also shows the low level of confidence. In contrast, men interrupt more to women at the time of conversation which increases the use of unnecessary words and hedge and tag questions which also reduce the confidence among women. In addition, women’s language include lots of instance and examples which also affect confidence of women (Kunsmann, 2013). Therefore, different ways of language used shows the lack of confidence among women.\nTentativeness: Women’s are more tentative as compare to men at the time of using different words in conversation. It occurrence sue to the use of words more frequently as compare to men. Including this, women uses extra polite and friendly words at the time of conversation which shows that lack of confidence or high nervousness of threating others by words. So, they use such kind of words which helps in maintaining effective communication with people (Ervin-Tripp, 2014). Therefore, tentativeness is also one of the major problem in women language.\nInterrupting behavior: It has be concluded by men interrupt others more than women. Analysis of the women’s language has reflected that women get interrupted more than men. Therefore, it can be concluded that women’s language is less interruptive as compare to men but she get more interruption at the time of conversations (Women’s Language, 2015).\nConversational feedback: Women do not provide appropriate feedback to their partner at the time of conversation as compare to men. Therefore, women’s language do not show effective conversational feedback to other women.</p>\n<h2>Major factors responsible for creating difference in the way by which women and men make interactions with others</h2>\n<p>There are difference factors which include gender cultures, socio-cultural phenomenon and communication styles are the major factors which create differences in the way by which women and men interact with each other. Besides that, gender base differences such as women are more emotional and intuitive as compared to men and highly intensive language” to persuade others etc. also influence personal interaction of gender in their daily life. Gender-based factor is responsible for creating interaction issue during personal interaction with attorneys and business people (Craver, 2003). In addition, difference between men and women during personal interaction can be highlighted on the basis of competitive situations, comfortable, self-confidence and intrinsic factors such as diligent work and intelligence etc. On the based on research studies of the brain done up to now, it can say that on the basis of various factors which include brain size (women brain is 8% smaller than men’s), multi-tasking, social thinking & interactions (women are better), emotions and math skills (Inferior-Parietal Lobule (IPL)” which is larger in men), difference in the way by which women and men interact with each other can be differentiated (Stone, 2009). Along with these factors, language (women are are more attuned to words and sounds), memory (Women generally have better memory than men), sense of direction and risk& rewards (Men has a brain wired for risk-taking) are the other causes responsible for creating difference in interaction between men and women candidates.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>The current research report has concluded that women use language in different style as compare to men which shows that lack of confidence and tentativeness among women. The current research report has also described different features of the women’s language such as hedge, tag questions, Politeness, Emotional emphasis, Empty adjectives, Correct grammar and pronunciation, Lack of humor, Direct quotations, Extended vocabulary and Declarations with interrogative intonation. All these features increases different issues such as Uncertainty, Politeness, Lack of confidence, Tentativeness, Interrupting behavior and Conversational feedback.</p>\n<h2>REFERENCES</h2>\n<li>Baxter, J., 2012.

As there is no specific information provided in regards to his return, it is assumed that he may leave the country indefinitely. This evident with his decision to sell almost all of his possessions that are owned by him in Australia such as his car, paintings and a flat. As per ITAA, 1997, it is crucial for the taxpayer to be physically present in Australia for at least some time. Since this is not true in case of Michael, he will be treated as a Non-Resident of Australia in future years. However, for the purpose of taxing his income up to February 2016, Michael would be considered as an Australian Resident as he has never been outside of the country previously. He also receives fully franked dividend worth $7,000 which can be attributed as a tax credit that seeks to reduce Michael’s overall tax burden by eliminating the possibility of double taxation. Additionally, he was entitled to be taxed as per the provisions of Capital gains tax for the assets sold by him. This includes sale of car which amounted to a total capital loss of $12,000. Additionally, Michael sold some of the paintings he possessed in the following fashion:</li>\n<table>

Also, enterprise tends to create a healthy and effective environment for staff so that they can work productively in a manner that helps organisation to reach success in near future. This reflects that organisation works towards satisfying the internal human resources so that can effectively manage and satisfy the external stakeholders and clients of company. I am also looking for a company where I can explore my field of interest by making use of skills and competencies. I am highly observant and possess strong analytical skills which are required for carrying out any research which is the prime task of Ipsos MORI. The company promote the atmosphere where individuals can freely work in a team environment and develop a sense of cohesion among themselves. I have worked in teams in past and always excelled in the task assigned to us collectively. Thus, I feel that this company totally matches with my behavioural attributes and skills and the requirements of entity complements my ideas and beliefs. Working in a company which is of my preference will assist me in working in a manner that will take enterprise to new heights in future.</li>\n<li>Tell us about a time you worked in a group to achieve an objective (what did you do and what was the outcome?)
While I was in college, there was a function organised for World Youth Skills Day in auditorium. For that day, a competition was also arranged by college faculties. Herein, students were supposed to work in a team of 10 people and prepare a power point presentation of 10 minutes. This presentation was to be based upon the success achieved by any multi-national corporation of our choice over a span of last 8 years. The demonstration was to be done in front of the whole college during the function. We decided to complete all the tasks and necessary preparation related to presentation in 4 meetings. During our first meeting, we collected and discussed all the pre requisites for the PPT. Also, the allotment of individual tasks for every person was done then. I was assigned two tasks, one was to make all arrangements for meeting and second was to prepare the Presentation finally. Both of them were difficult tasks without which the work given to us could not be completed. Also, the complexity in relation to arranging for meetings was that every person had a different time table which made it tougher for me to arrive at a time when all 10 of us were free. By having individual conversations with all of them, I was able to arrange meetings post which the opinions and views in relation to subject matter were shared and compiled. When all necessary data and numerical figures were successfully organised, I finally created a Power Point Presentation. When this PPT was presented in front of whole college, the faculties praised for us in-depth knowledge and study of organisation and its historical performance.</li>\n<li>Tell us about a time when you identified a new approach to solve a problem. (what did you do and what was the outcome?)\nWhen I was undertaking an internship at National Skills Society for a time span of 6 months, I was once given a task to collect and combine the results of a survey conducted of 500 persons who gave their opinion about “impact of globalisation on marketing function of company”. This data was to be presented by me to a group of individuals from non technical background. I was given a week to execute this task. I knew that if the data was presented in technical terminology, it would not be easily perceived by group. Thus, I planned to conduct a deep study about the survey and note the results in an organised manner. This helped me in converting the technical data into feasible language that could be easily interpreted by any person. Further, I decided to make a Power Point Presentation so as to present data organised by me in a structured manner for the group of working individuals. To successfully implement this, I made use of pie-charts, bar graphs and histograms so that data could be easily analysed by them without much knowledge about subject matter. On the final day of the presentation, the non-technical working group was impressed by me. They congratulated me for implementing the difficult task easily and wished me luck for my future avenues.</li>\n<li>Tell us about a time when you had to manage a number of different priorities and complete a number of tasks in a short amount of time. (what did you do and what was the outcome?)\nDuring my college tenure, I was given a project to be made upon a multi-national company of UK and its working patterns. Also, I was given the task to do some improvements in a project that I was given in last semester. It was difficult for me to do the prioritization of tasks as I had my semester exams in next week so I had to study for that also. Yet all these 3 tasks were urgent and needed to be done on a prior basis. Thus, I decided to ascertain time required for all the three tasks and then decide their superiority while doing things. After calculating individual time for all, I decided that I will first complete the old project in which I just had to make certain modifications so as to meet requirements of college faculties. Next on order list decided by me was the new project assigned to me recently and lastly, I decided to study for my exams. In this way, by prioritising all the projects, I successfully managed to complete every task within set time frame.</li>\n<li>Tell us about a project you worked on that required you to persuade others to your point of view. (what did you do and what was the outcome?)
During my tenure at BCD college, as a part of my college assignment, I was made to work with 4 students in a team and demonstrate “the effect of non governmental organisations on welfare of society”. When the the topic was given to us, my team mates thought that presenting the information on subject matter in form of written report would yield positive results. They were of this view as in past, one of the teams in previous batch also applied the same approach and attained maximum marks in class. I had a contrasting thought as I considered about presenting the data in visual form by way of bars, charts and other statistical tools and techniques. I planned to make a 1 minute demo of how I wanted the task to be executed. When I presented my views in front of group by way of a PPT, they were convinced with my approach and I was finally successful in persuading them to perform the task according to my view and belief.</li></ol>\n<h2>INTERVIEW PRACTICE</h2>\n<p>While I was in college, my batch was asked to attend a seminar where a number of delegates and professionals from various backgrounds came to share their experiences during the time of interview. The spokespersons from various renowned universities and professions gave seminars wherein they touched upon a few points specified below:-</p>\n<li>It is required by students like me to ensure that they carry all necessary documentation in relation to educational background and work experience.
</li>\n<li>Gestures and body movements also need to be specifically considered by me so as to be able to leave a good impression upon interviewer.
</li>\n<li>There should be any signs of under confidence or nervousness in my language or behaviour at the time of interview
</li>\n<li>I am supposed to reach interview location half an hour prior to interview process so as to show my punctuality and sincerity for the job position
</li>\n<h2>ASSESSMENT CENTRE PRACTICE
</h2>\n<p>During my tenure at college, when I attended the seminar on interview and behaviour required to be maintained during the process, the next day another seminar was arranged which discussed about assessment centres. The major points reflected in the seminar were:-</p>\n<li>When I go through the test at assessment centre, it is required by me to stay confident and motivated so as to demonstrate the given task well.</li>\n<li>Along with this, it is also essential that I possess an adaptive and spontaneous approach towards the assigned task so that I can begin with the task as soon as it is assigned to me.
</li>\n<li>Furthermore, I should use formal and polite language for carrying out conversation so as to be able to convey my views and opinions in an effective manner and leave an everlasting impression.

Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover, assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies. Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS.

        peragraph: `<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>It can be assessed that sun exposure and skin protection is considered as one of the major issue impacting upon the health of people especially the Australian farmers. Exposure from the sun causes skin damage and enhances the risk for developing skin cancer. However, Australia has reached to the highest rate in skin cancer disease globally (Jeffery, C. A and et. al., 2014). Also, it has been identified that farmers receives at least three times the UV exposure as compared to indoor workers. Thus, health care services have been increased in particular country and farmers are asked to wear a UV measuring device on their forehead during the whole European summer. Main effects to farmers of the sun exposure was between 12-4 pm when farmers carry out the activity such as mustering cattle and fixing fences.\nSkin protection is considered as one of the major issue impacting upon the health of Australian farmers and thus overcome such risk by adopting protective measures such as appropriate clothing and UV creams would helps in decreasing the risk of sun exposure. Thus, government also focusing upon promoting health campaign and thus protecting people living in rural and remote areas of Australia and overcome their health issue. In the global world, rural and agricultural population are known to be at high risk for skin cancer (Hegney, 2012). Thus, Australian farmers have been reaching a higher standardised mortality rate due to melanoma and other skin cancers. Further, there are certain factors that may increase the risk of skin cancer such as UV rays and thus reducing such risk may prevent individual from such diseases. Therefore, Australian farmers are provided better control measures in regard to protect themselves from UV and thus overcome risk factor of skin cancer. Hence, it can be stated that sun exposure causes harmful impact upon the health of Australian farmers (Sato, M and et. al., 2015).\nCare setting is focused upon delivering better care facilities to people living in rural and remote areas of Australia in regard to provide them proper care and support services so that they live healthy life. It is also essential for investigate the health issues within population i.e. Australian farmers regarding sun exposure and skin protection issues that impacts the health of farmers (Boehm, Franklin and King, 2014). Therefore, HSC plays as crucial role in providing care to farmers and inform them different ways of protecting themselves from the rays of sun so that it could not harm their skin. Following are the different risk factors for sun exposure such as Fair skin, Sunburns, Excessive sun exposure, Sunny or high altitude climates and Skin cancer.\nUV light is a major risk factor that affects an individual’s chance of getting a disease such as cancer. Through run rays skin cancer is caused and thus therefore nursing is remote areas needs to be provided properly so that farmers can be protected from UV radiation. Excess of sun exposure is harmful for skin and main work of farmers is carried out in day between 12-4 pm and thus sun rays affects them. Therefore, it is essential for rural and remote area nursing to provide proper treatment to farmers so that they can be safeguarded from radiation (Jeffery, C. A and et. al., 2014).\nHere, nurses play a significant role in delivering health care services to people in rural and remote areas of Australia so that farmers can be protected from prevailing health issue i.e. skin problems. Care home needs to give maximum care and support to Australian farmers living in rural and remote areas so that they can understand the ill effects of sun exposure and skin protection that impacts the health of farmers (Hegney, 2012). Proper health campaign needs to be launched so that information regarding health issues could be provided to people in regard to assess the risk factors for sun exposure within Australian farmer population and its impact on health outcomes.\nIt shows the number of doctors and nurses working in remote and rural areas of Australia so that health needs of farmers could be fulfilled. These are not sufficient as it is not meeting the requirement which assesses that number of doctors and nurses needs to be increased that helps in providing better care facilities to farmers so that they can overcome their health issue (Abdoli and Abdoli, 2015).\nSun damage among farmers is due to protonged exposure t solar radiation and is considered as serious problem for farmers. There are various risk factors that is significant for sun damage in farmers include long duration to exposure, wearing minimal clothing, white skin that burns easily etc. However, agricultural work also increases the risk of cancer mainly due to exposure of sunlight (Chuenkongkaew, W. L and et. al., 2016). Thus, rural and remote nurses and doctors are required to focus upon such health issue that helps in overcoming the risk in regard to deliver best care and support services to farmers.\nIn 2015, recoverable amount is higher than carrying figure so there is no journal entry has been made.</p>\n<h2>C.

        peragraph: `<p>Communication is an integral part of our day-to -day life which not only help us to share or transmit knowledge, but also help us to contextually relate to other human beings. Human beings use several forms of verbal or non-verbal communication to express numerous emotions.  Robust communication skills are required for a harmonious personal life as well as a successful professional life. Though, strong communications skills can help an individual to excel in any profession, but these prove to be a pivotal set of skills for some professionalsviz. healthcare or nursing.  Among all the healthcare professionals, nurses are the only team member who interact with almost all stakeholders of the healthcare team. Through effective communications nurses bridge the gap between patients and doctors(physicians). Nurses are anticipated to judge the situation and use apt set of communication framework while having staff to staff interactions across disciplines, units or hospitals; staff to patient communication; and staff to family/carer/advocate communication\nThe present paper deliberates one such important communication framework i.e. assertive communication which is used during nursing communications. The paper uses a hypothetical scenario as an example to explain the basic concept, strength and limitations, and application strategies of assertive communication in nursing. The paper also critically analyses the necessity of using assertive communication in the chosen scenario.\nAssertiveness is the ability to express one’s feelings, opinions, beliefs, and needs directly, openly and honestly, while not violating the personal rights of others (Ellis & Hartley, 2005). Traditionally, it was believed that a nurse should be acquiescent and submissive while communicating with the doctors/ patients/ family/caregiver (Slater 1990; Poroch & McIntosh 1995). But, over the period of a paradigm shift has been observed in nature of nursing profession, healthcare laws, and legal rights of nurses (particularly female). These changes in the healthcare scenario compel the nurses to explore other sets/ frameworks of communication, assertive communication being one of them. Being assertive doesn’t imply to be aggressive or rude while communicating. Rather it means to voice your opinion in a positive way by staying calm and standing for your or other people’s right. Though in some people assertiveness comes naturally, yet some need to learn it by practice and application. There are basically two model which can be applied for practicing assertive communication in nursing. First one is “See it, Say it, Fix it”, this implies to looking into the situation and critically analysing it, thinking analytically about what should be communicated and saying it, and working together with the other person to resolve or fix it.  Another model used for applying assertive communication is  a descriptive version of three-step model explained earlier and is known as the “Five-step model”. This model uses a five-step approach to resolve the problem and effectively communicating the message: getting other person’s attention, expressing concern, being direct and unambiguous while communicating, stating the problem and explanation (if required), proposing a plan of action, and reaching to the right decision by positive discussion.\nFor example, in the chosen hypothetical scenario, a nurse was advised by the team members to communicate with the family/friends of a young man who is brought to hospital unconscious with serious head injuries. The nurse is supposed to inform the family that the patient is unconscious and needs to be shifted to intensive care unit for further management. However, the family responded aggressively for the delay in information and invaded the personal space of the nurse by poking on shoulder. In current scenario, being passive and accepting the aggressive behaviour of the family members could create a havoc situation which could negatively affect the self-esteem of the nurse.  As quoted by George Bernard Shaw “the greatest problem in communication is the illusion that it has been accomplished.”  Being passive in such scenario might give an impression of having empathy with the family members, but it could give a wrong message of negligence on part of hospital and healthcare team. Passiveness or lack of assertive communication skills in nurse are often picked up as inferiority complex (O’Mara 1995). However, assertive communication in such scenario reflects a direct, open and honest explanation, which clarifies one’s needs to the other person. Hence, in such scenario an assertive framework of communication is required.Burnard (1992), also stated that assertiveness depicts professional confidence among nursing professionals and should be encouraged.\nIn the current scenario, it is recommended that a nurse should apply a five-step model of assertive communication framework. Direct and clear communication is one of the important element of assertive communication. It is important that the nurse stay direct in the communication with the family members of the patient. It is necessary that the nurse call them by their name (if not known, may ask first whom he/she is speaking too). This generate a feeling of acquaintance with the family, and gives an impression that nurse is well-acquainted about the patient. Using indirect ways to address gives an impression of lack of knowledge about the patient. Second important thing is maintaining the eye-contact while talking with the family. This shows confidence in the communication. Choice of words is another important aspect. The message delivered to the family should be clear and precise in a language understandable to them. Try not to use too much medical vocabulary or jargons, as these might create confusion in the family members. It is also required that a nurse explain the further plan of management, why it is required for the patient, and how the healthcare team will execute it to the family. A nurse should always ask for a feedback once the explanation/ information is provided to the family.  This reduces the chances of misinterpretation.\nThe second element of assertive communication is being apologetic about any delays or inconvenience caused by healthcare team or their counterparts.  As described in the scenario chosen, the family is already furious about delay in information about their patient. So, in such case it is necessary that the nurse empathise with their situation and provide them legit explanation about why the information was provided late to them. It is advised that a nurse should not built up any lame stories to cover up the mistakes by the healthcare team in delaying the information to the family. Rather, in such case it is required that a nurse accept the fault on the counterpart and give a genuine explanation the delay.\nThe third most important element in assertive communication framework is to understand the rights and voice your opinion. It is necessary for a nurse to understand that being accepting and subservient is not part of the job responsibility. It is required that a nurse should stand for his/her self-respect and self-esteem. Invasion of personal space, even though by a grief stuck family members should not be accepted. As described in the hypothetical situation, the family member invaded the personal space by poking on the shoulder. Hence, under such situation, the nurse should express the uneasiness caused in a firm voice, explain that such gestures are unacceptable, and if require warn the family member of strict action if this kind of behaviour is repeated. Even though, such communication is required in such situation, yet most of the nurses refrain from using assertive communication. As concluded by Valentine (1995), nurses believe that they are expected to resolve a conflict by caring and interpersonal obligation rather by voicing their rights.\nIt is required that the nurses understand that assertiveness is ability to express one’s feelings, opinions, beliefs, and needs directly, openly and honestly, while not violating the personal rights of others. As seen in the hypothetical scenario used it is need of the situation to be assertive. By openly expressing the discomfort against invasion of personal space and honestly explaining the cause of delay in providing the information about the patient to the family members should not be considered as aggressive behaviour. Rather, clarity and straight-forwardness in the communication will help the nurse in developing strong interpersonal relations with the family members. Peplau, 1997 also stated that interpersonal relations are important in nursing.Establishing a trusting interpersonal relationship allows nurses to make suggestions, communicate openly with patients and family members and be assertive in the patient care.\nAnother important aspect of communication in this scenario is the clarity of the communication. Family members of the patient who are not well-informed often develop anger against the healthcare staff anticipating negligence on their part. Hence, it is important that a nurse bring out a clear communication with the family member. A nurse should clearly explain the events as they have happened once the patient has been admitted to the hospital. The exact procedures which are carried out and their relevance for interest of patient health. It is also necessary that the nurse have a clarity while briefing the next steps which are planned for the patient and hoe they will be executed. A clear explanation from nurse will help the family member to gain confidence in the healthcare team and the management strategies planned for their patient. It is also vital to gain consent from them regarding medical procedures.\nNurses are a very resourceful member of the health care team, they are efficient in drawing variety of physical and psychological intervention that facilitates management of the patients and provide empathy to the care providers. However, it has been observed that nurses are often typecast in terms of their behaviour and communication, and are anticipated to communicate in a defined. With changes in time and trends of healthcare and expansion of job responsibilities of the nurses, it is required that nurses understand the requirement of different sets of communication skills like assertive communication. It is necessary that the nurses understand that being assertive boosts their communication skills and help them to grow as a professional. Various nursing literature have repeatedly called for teaching assertive communication skills to the nursing students as part of early learning, as well encourage them to practice by role play or in real life situations.  It is required that all nursing professional should understand that being assertive is not equivalent to being aggressive, rather it is a sign of self-confidence, believing in your work, and standing for your opinion.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<h2>From this report, it can be concluded that communication play vital role in order to develop trust and confidence within the patient and their family members. In accordance with the case, a patient was bought to the hospital with head injury and got unconscious. Their family members where waiting for long time in the waiting room. They are really upset for not providing them proper information regarding what had happened to the patient. As per the situation, it is important to have assertive communication that will enable to convey the information. Further, there are two models for practising assertive communication. Among the two, five steps model is taken into consideration. Further, it is essential to have proper eye contact and to deliver information by stating their name. This is helpful in conveying the information and to make their situation under control.\nIn 2015, recoverable amount is higher than carrying figure so there is no journal entry has been made.</h2>\n<p>C. Explaining the reasons for impairment\nIn 2014, carrying amount is $200000, whereas recoverable amount implies for $110000. Hence, carrying amount is higher than recoverable cost which shows the loss of $90000. Carrying cost – recoverable amount $200000 – $110000 = $90000</p>\n<h2>D. Presenting the amount of plant and equipment in balance sheet</h2>\n<p>In balance sheet, revaluate amount of plant and equipment is recorded by business entity after doing final reversal.</p>\n<h1>QUESTION 3</h1>\n<h2>Interpreting the technical requirements and importance of international accounting standards</h2>\n<p>International Accounting standards have high level of importance which ensures high level transparency and standardization in the financial statements. Hence, final accounts which are prepared according to IFRS are highly reliable in nature and thereby helps stakeholders in making decisions (Florou, Kosi and Pope, 2017). However, technical knowledge is highly required among the individuals or accounting personnel to deal with the aspects of International Accounting Standards such as IAS 12 and 26 etc. In this, accounting personnel must have ability to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities. Moreover, assets, revenue received in advance, other liabilities, unrecognized items; consolidated financial statements are the main bases of taxation (Warren, 2016). By taking into consideration all such bases accounting personnel can assess or determine the tax liability. In addition to this, in IAS 12 contains rules regarding the measurement of deferred tax. Along with this, tax rate are also varied from one year to another. In this, accounting personnel is required to update with changing rules and policies. Through this, finance manager and accounting personnel would become able to determine suitable tax liability. In addition to this, IAS 26 serves information about retirement plans which can be distinguished into two types such as defined benefit and contribution plan. Hence, it clearly presents information about the recording, measurement and disclosure of information regarding the retirement benefit plans. Hence, for effective presentation accounting personnel must have knowledge regarding the rules and regulations which are related to it (Bond, Govendir and Wells, 2016). Thus, by considering all such aspects it can be said that technical and conceptual knowledge is highly required for dealing with the standards more effectively and efficiently. Moreover, reporting and measurement aspect of pension plan is highly differing from one standard to another (McPhail, Macdonald and Ferguson, 2016). For instance: UK GAAP has different rules in relation to treatment on pension benefits in against to IAS. Hence, conceptual understanding and knowledge is highly required for dealing with the amount of retirement benefits and deferred tax amount. There are several key issues which are associated with financial reporting enumerated below:</p>\n<li>Reporting needs and requirements are mentioned in the regulations which business entity requires following for ensuring transparency in the final accounts. However, sometimes is not possible for the business organization to comply with all the rules to the large extent.</li>\n<li>Further, some government authorities have framed and introduced legislation which entail that companies are not obliged to prepare financial statements according to accounting standards. Moreover, sometimes treasurer directives also enforce accounting standard which company has to follow for the preparation of financial statements.</li>\n<h2>References</h2>\n<li>Bond, D., Govendir, B. and Wells, P., 2016.

        peragraph: `<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>\n<p>Nursing management can be determined as the performance related to the function of leadership of decision making and governance within the organization that is employing nurses. Further, it included all the functions for management like organizing, staffing, controlling, directing and planning. There are different type of department that are handled by nurses. Present report is based on a case of Joshua who born within 29 weeks gestation and it was found that he has respiratory distress. This report covers priorities of nursing management admission to neonatal nursery. Further, it covers short and long term complications of using CPAP. Lastly, it also includes long term problems that Joshua and his family will experience due to Joshua’s preterm birth.</p>\n<h1>Question 1</h1>\n<h2>Five priorities of nursing management</h2>\n<p>There are different set of priorities that has to be followed by nurses towards the patient. There are many immediate care that has to be provided to new born baby. In this context, below given are the five priorities that has to be followed:\nDelivering proper care: There are different type of requirements that a patient and their child need. It is important to make sure that all type of services are being delivered to them. In this context, it is the main priority that all the information that is provided by patient is not being disclosed to anyone (Cools, Offringa and Askie, 2015). In this context, it essential that all the basic requirement so that delivery can be conducted proper should be considered. During delivery time, there are different type of complications that can be caused and for each of the issues or problems, it is important to consider that all things are considered and adequate steps are taken with the help of which complications can be reduced. Further, there should be equipments and tools ready in can of emergency.\nHealth assessment: It is essential to conduct health assessment. In this context, it includes test like blood pressure, pulse rate, etc. For the baby, it is essential for the nurse to make sure that all the muscle tone are correct. Further, pulse rate should be checked. Moreover, colour of skin, respiration, etc. should be considered. These are the basic function that needs to be considered. When there are issues in relation with any of the determined areas are identified, then immediate steps should be taken so that proper care can be provided. More specifically, there is score that is given by nurses for each of the baby that is born (Kirpalani, Millar and Roberts, 2013). It is given out of 10 and if it is 7 of more than that, then it is considered to be normal. However, in cases if the score is give is between 4 to 6, then this shows that baby should be given with some resuscitation measures and proper monitoring. In addition to this, it the score is below 3, then immediate life saving techniques and resuscitation should be given.\nPhysical examination: It is essential to conduct proper physical examination in order to check the signs that there is any type of issues that is identified in the new born baby. At the time, baby is born, there are immediate steps that in order to make sure that there is not serious issues that are faced by the child. This generally take place within nursery or delivery room but it depends upon the policies that are followed in hospital (Overman, Liu and Moore, 2013). There are different type of procedures that are followed and it includes measurement of heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature. Further, it includes measurement of length, head circumference and weight. It enables to determine whether the growth is normal or not. Special care is provided to babies who are born underweight or are very large. Once the temperature of the baby is stabilized, then they first bath is given. In addition to this, footprints are taken for medical record.\nCare to new born: All the babies are observed and those who have normal weight and stabilized body temperature are given bath immediately. On the other hand, child who has child who are born premature are given special care and are kept understand observation and care is provided according to their requirement.\nMonitoring and observation: At the time when child is kept at CPAP, it is important that proper observation should be made so that all the changes that taken place in child should be observed (Sharma, Clark and Keszler, 2015). It is essential to make sure that there is proper pressure maintained in CPAP so that baby will be able to recover quickly.\nIn accordance with the case, it can be started that Joshua was a premature baby and weighted 1200 grams. He had issues in relation with respiration and so he was given CPAP. With this respect, it is important to consider that the steps taken by nurses at that point of time were right as the child needed oxygen. In this context, positive pressure ventilation was given and so that with time the child will be able to overcome the problem of respiration after proper observation.</p>\n<h2>Question 2</h2>\n<h1>Question 2</h1>\n<h2>Three potential long or short term complications of using CPAP and strategies to reduce risk</h2>\n<p>CAPA (Continuous positive airway pressure) is a type of positive airway pressure ventilator. This is helpful to apply mild air pressure continuously so that person gets proper oxygen. There are different type of long term complications that are faced by the use of CPAP. In this context, below given are three long term complications:\nBloody nose: This is one of the long term complication that is faced due to CPAP during preterm birth. Further, there is not fixed time in which a person’s nose can bleed. In this, there is not pain felt but excess loss of blood causes blood lose and haemoglobin rate within body (Greenough, Murthy and Sundaresan, 2016). Their cases in which it becomes difficult to stop bleeding and it causes serious health issues for the person. Further, it is difficult to find out that main reason due to which type of issue is caused. When CPAP is given, then mouth and nose is covered with mask and when the pressure of oxygen is not properly stabilized as per requirement, then it affects nose and this causes a reason for nose bleeding.\nBreathing problems: Lungs gets affected when CPAP is given. The respiratory system also gets negatively affects. There are cases in which patient is not able to perform physical exercise and when such activities are performing, then it becomes difficult to breath and this result in unconsciousness. To perform any type of role, it requires proper concentration and when body fails to breath in enough oxygen, then it creates issues so as to complete the work effectively. It is essential to inhale enough oxygen so that body functioning can be operated effectively. It is important to make oxygen reach all part of the body. However, there are cases in which due to CPAP used during preterm birth increases the rate of issues related to breathing.\nStomach problem: Due to CPAP machine, there are cases in which it causes stomach pain and bloating. This type of issue arises as the air pressure that is set on the machine make it pump high pressure of air into the mask (Szyld, Aguilar and  Musante, 2014). This is caused when nurses do not take proper care to adjust with sleep specialist. Stomach problems creates issue for digestion when anything that is consumed causes pain and it also creates issue for taking food inside.\nThere are different strategies that are implemented in order to make sure that the rate of negative impact is reduced that is caused because of CPAP. In this context, during the situation of preterm birth, it is important that there is proper monitoring done of the baby. There are cases in which serious issues can cause to the child if the pressure is more compared with the required one (Cools, Offringa and Askie, 2015). In order words, it requires real time monitoring enables to reduce the risk of lung damage. Further, protective strategy is used by nurses in order to make sure that the rate of lung damages caused by CPAP can be reduced. When a child like Joshua is place in CPAP, then it is important that there is proper monitoring so that in case of any emergency situation or problems can be reduced.</p>\n<h1>Question 3</h1>\n<h2>Four potential long term problems that Joshua and his family due to Joshua’s preterm birth</h2>\n<p>There are different type of problems that can be faced by Joshua and his family due to Joshua’s preterm birth. In this context, below given are four of the potential long term problems: Intellectual and developmental disabilities: With age there are certain growth that occurs to a child. In this context, it includes physical and mental development. However, when child like Joshua who had premature birth have difficulties in physical development (Kirpalani, Millar and Roberts, 2013). Further, there are issues in relation with learning thing which normally same age children can perform. Moreover, it becomes difficult to have proper communication with other. It is important to have proper interaction with for the family of Joshua but it becomes difficult for them to understand or also difficult for Joshua to make them understand regrading the thing that he wants to convey. Further, children with premature birth prefer to be alone and do not get easily adjusted with others. Further, the basic things that a child can perform of the same age of Joshua but he can find it difficult for the same. Further, there are also conditions in which the growth of any one of the body part can get affected. Autism: This is a type of behavioural disorder. In this child gets affected with behavioural, social and speech. This has negative impact over brain, spinal cord and nerves. It becomes difficult for the child to perform basic activities and in having proper communication with others (Overman, Liu and Moore, 2013). There are conditions in which parents also does not have proper information about it and they fail to make sure that proper care is being provided to them. This is a type of disease that does not have proper care. However, the only thing that can be done is to reduce the negative impact by therapies. It becomes difficult to have a social life as in autism it becomes to make other understand. Lung problem: One of the disease that is caused when lungs gets affected is Asthma. It is a type of condition that affects the airways and increases breathing problems. Breathing problems affects social life and it is important to have continuous meditation so that the rate of issues can be solved. Further, there is another type of lung related issues that is caused among premature babies that is Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). There are chances that Joshua can get affected with this type of disease (Sharma, Clark and Keszler, 2015). As per this lung disease, it causes lungs to grow abnormally or to be inflamed. With time this type of issue get reduced but the chances of getting asthma is high and it their symptoms remains throughout their life. Heath problems: Joshua is at high risk to have health related problems. In this context, it includes intestinal problems this is generally caused to premature babies who are also known as necrotizing enterocolitis. This is a type of disease that affects intestine of babies. Intestine is body function that help to break down food. Majority of child who are premature overcome the problems of intestine but for most of them it stays for life long. Further, it also causes different type of infections like meningitis that is a type of infection which caused in brain. Further, it includes pneumonia a type of infection which is caused in lungs. Moreover, premature babies also face problem of vision (Greenough, Murthy and Sundaresan, 2016). In this context, it induces diseases like retinopathy of prematurity. In addition to this, it also includes dental problem and hearing loss.</p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>As per the findings, it can be stated that proper information should be provided to parents related with the health issues that are being faced. Further, it is important to have effective communication so that there is strong relationship developed among nurses and patient. This way trust and confidence is developed. Moreover, nurses has to take immediate actions at the time of delivery as what type of issue can take place is not fixed. Further, there are certain steps and procedures that has to be followed by nurses and all those should be considered. When the temperature is stabilized, then new born baby should be given bath</p>\n<h2>REFERENCES</h2>\n<li>Cools, F., Offringa, M. and Askie, L. M., 2015.

        peragraph: `<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Organisations that are effective stays in lengthy operations and are more profitable as compared to their rivals. There are certain traits of an effective organisation such as corporate social responsibility, clear directions, open communication, empowerment of employees and team building. One of the major element of effective organisation is that it should assure that its key operating principles, organisational structure and culture, job responsibilities are entirely integrated with its strategies and they delivers betterment in performance (Upadhaya Munir and Blount, 2014). Effectiveness in an organisation can be fostered through dimensions like optimistic leadership, strategic individual roles and organisational structures, talented workforce, effectual change management and allied and involved organisational culture. The present report is prepared on effective organisation and consultancy process considering the case study of Welsh Utilities Regular (WUR). This is a non-departmental public body made from a legislation passed in 2004 that is held accountable for regulating electricity, water, sewerage and gas industries in Wales for promoting short term as well as long term interests of patrons. It is not a policy-making government department, but it assures that water and energy utility industries are regulated and developed according to the ministerial policies that are made in its legal duties.\nThe report is intended to make certain changes in performance management policy of WUR. Currently, the performance management policy provides employees an annual pay bonus about 35 percent of their present salary. This policy was expected to help in attracting and retaining top talented workers from private sector. The chosen organisation is required to attract and retain main workers who are having good knowledge and expertise for reputed gas and electricity firms. The board has asked to review the performance management approach of WUR so that when employees are given their bonus, it should develop a feeling in them that it is due to their job objectives and their performance which went above the set expectations and targets. For this purpose, Total Quality Management (TQM) has been taken into account for improving the performance management policies of WUR.\nMain Body\nLiterature review\nConcept of Total Quality Management\nAccording to the views of Sallis, (2014) Total Quality Management is an approach of management which was propounded in 1950s and slowly it became a very famous approach since early 1980s. It describes the attitude, culture and organisation of a firm which strives for providing its consumers with those products and services which satisfies their wants and desires. This is a method through which management and staff gets engaged in the constant improvement of production of products and services. This approach is a combo of management tools and quality aiming at increase in business and decreasing losses because of inefficient policies and practices. It is a management philosophy which aims at integrating all functions of organisation such as finance, marketing, production, customers service, engineering etc. for focusing on fulfilling need of patrons and objectives of organisation as well. This approach views a firm as a combination of processes. This method tries to maintain that firms should try to constantly improve the processes by implementing skills and competencies of employees. However, Goetsch and Davis, (2014) argued that Total Quality Management can be summed-up as a management system for customer oriented organisation which engages its staff for continuous betterment. This system takes use of strategies, data and effectual communication for integrating quality discipline within culture and activities of an organisation. Several concepts are currently used in modern Quality Management Systems that is a modern form of TQM. This approach is an enhancement in the old methods of doing business. It is a proven tool which gives guarantee of survival in the cut-throat competition. Just by making changes in management actions, entire organisational culture and actions gets transformed. There are four important phases in Total Quality Management. The first stage is Planning phase in which is the most essential stage in TQM. At this step, staff is told to convey their problems and issues which should be resolved. They are told to come up with their challenges which they face during their routine jobs and examines the root cause of problem. At this stage, staff is needed to conduct some important research and gather relevant data and information that will be helpful to find out solutions for all problems. Then comes the second phase of doing. Here staff tries to bring out a solution for the problems and issues which were defined in the previous step. Strategies are designed and executed for overcoming the challenges and the effectiveness of strategies and solutions are checked. The third stage is of checking under which comparative assessment of before and after data is done for confirming the effectiveness of processes and to measure outcomes. The last phase is called as acting phase in which employees showcase their outcomes and get ready to solve other issues.\nBasic elements of TQM\nThe successful implementation of Total Quality Management should include technical as well as people aspects which covers the whole organisation and broaden to relationship with patrons and suppliers. The basic constituents covers the gist of TQM philosophy in which first one is focus on customers. Wang Chen and Chen, (2012) stated that decision regarding organisation of resources for best serving the consumers begins with a clear-cut apprehension of wants and needs of patrons and measurement of consumer gratification. For instance, WUR is responsible in regulation of electricity, water, sewerage and gas industries for promotion of short term and long term interests of customers as well. Thus, by knowing needs and experiences of patrons regarding the services which they are getting for water supply, gas, electricity supply, sewerage system, WUR can identify the strengths and weaknesses of the services and makes changes if desired. The next important element of TQM is continuous improvement. If an organisation has a constant learning culture and problem solving culture then there are very less chances of defects and mistakes. The Toyota Production System is a universally accepted system for continuous improvement which is utilised by many distinct types of firms. There are some crucial components of this system which consists of study of process flow, collection of data and information, removing out the waste non-value-added tasks and activities and giving everybody the responsibility of quality improvement. Nevertheless, Oakland, (2014) asserted that employee involvement is an another constituent of Total Quality Management. Under a TQM environment, employees have distinct roles and responsibilities compared with a traditional organisation. They are provided accountability, training and authorization for measuring and controlling the quality of work they are producing, they work collectively for addressing the issues related to quality, they are given cross training to make them capable to do multiples tasks and develop understanding of total production process, and they are having a more intense apprehension of operating and maintaining the equipments. Employees are important for building constant betterment in an organisation. The next essential component of TQM is quality tools which is extended above the scope of this discussion, but there are seven quality tools which are taken in use by front-line managers and employees to monitor quality performance and collect data for making improvement in quality activities. These tools consists of flowcharts, checklists, scatter diagrams, Pareto analysis, histograms, fish-bone diagrams. Another essential element of TQM is product design which is a major activity for avoiding costly interior and exterior cost related to failures. Process management is one more crucial component of TQM which states that management and staff should emphasise on detailed activities in a process in which poor or good quality is made. The last but significant constituent of TQM is supplier quality. The attention on quality is on the part of supplier also, as the quality of end product is only good as quality of its detached parts and elements, irrespective of whether they come via intrinsic or extrinsic sources\nTools of Total Quality Management\nWhen an organisation wants to initiate a Total Quality Management Program or make improvements in it, it has to take use of some common tools for quality improvement procedures. In accordance with the view of Talib Rahman and Qureshi, M.N., (2013) the purpose of Total Quality Management is to decrease the happenings of mistakes within manufacturing or service procedures. With this, firms are able to streamline and kind of modifications by updating equipments and training to staff in an effective manner. This in turn will satisfy patrons. But firms are not able to apply Total Quality Management without taking use of correct tools. The first tools is Pareto Principle which states that most of mistakes occur due to certain causes. In terms of ratio, 80 percent of problems are related to 20 percent of causes. Thus, this tool points out that 20 percent causes the problem. This principle permits managers to deal with strictness with this 20 percent which is cause of the issue that usually consists of machine or operating errors. The next tool is control charts under which data is plotted in a historical manner to see the changes in processes with the time. These charts holds a central line for average, upper and lower line which shows the upper and lower control limitation. Flow charts are also supporting in TQM as they permit management to see the flow of processes is well or not. This is done with the help of words, pictures etc. along with pointers to next data flow point. The data flow points includes problems, solutions, objectives etc. Withal, Conti, (2012) quoted that an another tools is Scatter Plots and Diagrams. Generally, scatter plot resembles like a line graph without any line. The point of data points in this is to depict in what manner one data point correlated with other data point in positive or negative manner. If data is close to create a straight line, then there is great possibility that one point is correlated with the next point. Diagrams are also used for analysing process distribution which is done through cause and effect diagrams that showcases the key cause and less causes can impact a problems. The intended impact will be that problem will get solved. But the diagram will depict the either mode. For instance, WUR can takes use of this tools when managers want to coordinate data in a positive manner and make a straight line. Check sheets and Checklists are the ultimate key TQM tools. Check sheets are the forms which collect data and permit users to analyse and interpret data easily. They are only meant for collecting single kind of data and information at one time. Therefore, they are very good for that type of which is going to repeat many times. On the other hand, checklists ate for dealing with a particular problems which allows managers of WUR to check and see whether all essential steps have been taken or not. They are same as check-sheets, they are taken in use for assisting along with the operation processes and not collecting the data. One more tool of TQM is force field analysis which is utilised for identification of driving and restricting forces happening under a selected process for understanding why that specific process functions as it does. For identifying restricting forces which should be eliminated, or driving forces which are require to be improved, for functioning at a high efficiency level. An another significant tool of Total Quality Management is histograms which are graphical representation of distribution of numeric data. This is an estimation of probability distribution of a quantitative variable which is continuous. This is a type of bar graphs. For constructing a histogram, the initial step is “bin” the range of values which means to divide the whole range of values in a serial of intervals and after that count the values which comes under every interval. Bins are generally specified as non-overlapping and sequential intervals of variable. The bins should be adjacent and should be mostly of equivalent size. If they are having equal size, a rectangle erects over the bins with a high proportion to frequency i.e. number of cases under every bin. This tool provide a rough idea of density of inherent data distribution and most of the times for estimating density : estimation of probability density function of the inherent variable.\nCritically evaluating the extent to which TQM can improve organisational effectiveness\nThere may be a debate on the extent to which TQM tools within WUR can improve its effectiveness. This is being assumed that TMQ is helpful in highlighting the market needs. The application of TQM is universally acceptable and is supportive for organisation such as WUR in identifying and fulfilling market needs in a better manner. Bon and Mustafa, (2013) argued that it is helpful to energising innovation process. Innovations and inventions emphasise on quality of services. The innovative aspects of key or peripheral services appeals to the services users. Also the professionals find it easy to market the innovative services in a profitable manner. TQM leads to cost effectiveness which is very important for endurance of any type of organisation. Organisations should be aiming at spending their resources in a productive way. During development of services, due attention should be paid to cost-benefit analysis. Training sessions and incentive plans should be brought for making the employees more productive. However it can also be argued that implementation of total quality management system in chosen firm needs extensive training to workers and it needs them to give some time from their routine work responsibilities and roles. While the betterment does decreases lead time, removes wastage and improves productivity, the initial stages of execution of total quality management within an organisation can decrease employee output. On the other side, implementation of TQM is favoured by Madu, (2012) saying that it ensures better quality performance in each domain of activities. Adverse and non-involvement attitude and behaviour of staff are the most significant hurdle in success, growth and advancement of organisation. TQM focuses on introducing attitudinal changes and betterment in employee performance by encouraging appropriate work culture and efficacious team work. It offers fabulous chances for self development and increasing interests of workers towards their jobs. The techniques and tools of TQM are significantly assistive in knowing and understanding the competition and also in development of an effectual combating strategies. Because of the intense competition, survival of several firms is a vital issue. Total Quality Management is helpful in understanding the patrons and market as well. It gives a chance to organisation to face the competition by applying the TQM techniques. Nevertheless, the counter argument of Al-Swidi and Mahmood, (2012) is a weak point of TQM which says that total quality management needs change is thinking, attitude and ways of performing jobs by staff. If the management does not communicate the team approach of TQM is an effective manner, employees may develop fear in their minds which results in employee resistance.\nIf employees resists towards TQM programme, it can lessen staff morale and productivity for the organisation. Also it is an expensive approach for implementation. Execution of this technique mostly brings additional training cost, team development costs, consultancy fees, improvement cost in infrastructure and many more. This system emphasises on standardisation of tasks for ensuring consistency which discourages creativity and innovation in organisation. This also discourages new and out-of-box ideas which are likely to make improvement in productivity. This is further supported by fact stated by Herzallah Gutiérrez-Gutiérrez and Munoz Rosas, (2014) total quality management programmes remove defects and wastage that results in reduction of production cost of businesses. When teams meets for identifying and eliminating weaknesses in the business, firm enjoys decreased costs and high profitability. Team of quality management are able to eliminate mistakes and errors, decrease lead time and determine redundancy in the process of production which can importantly add in the profits that are earned by organisations. TQM showcases a fair image of services. This system facilitates service organisation in delivering consistent quality of products. Furthermore, to maintain consistency in profit producing inspires all the parties which are concerned about this. They make a favourable viewpoint regarding services firm. Patrons receives quality services, staff gets fabulous incentives and investors attains profitable returns on their investments which they made. Thus, Total Quality Management depicts a fair image of service firms amid general public that is helpful for organisation to progress slowly in the long run. TQM is also helpful in development of a sufficient system of communication. Defective and insufficient communication and inappropriate processes are an obstacle in the path of appropriate development and growth of a firm. This leads to confusions, misunderstandings, lower productivity, bad quality, copying of of efforts given by staff and lower morale. Techniques of TQM brings together the individuals of several linked sections, departments and management levels for efficacious communication and interaction.\nConclusion\nThe current report is prepared on effective organisation and consultancy process for which case study of Welsh Utilities Regular (WUR) is taken into account. From the above report it is concluded that to improve performance management approaches in chosen organisation, Total Quality Management will be the most suitable tool. The concept of total quality management has been discussed in the report from which it is observed that it is a way from which managers and employees gets involved in continual betterment of production of goods and services. Certain tools of TQM such as Pareto, Principle, control charts, flow charts, scatter plots and diagrams, check sheets and Checklists, force field analysis and histograms are being determined in the report which are significantly supporting the cited organisation. It is to be summed up that these tools have proved effective for making improvement in performance and effectiveness of quoted organisation. Then a critical assessment of degree to which TQM can improve organisational effectiveness is being conducted in the report from which it is concluded that TQM system should be applied by making a balance betwixt its strengths and drawbacks by the stated firm.\nReferences</p>\n<li>Sallis, E., 2014.

    </table>\nPotential Risks\nEvery project contains several risks which negatively hamper the outcomes and deliverables of the project work. In the context of ERP project for Abundant Produce Limited, project manager has appointed a Risk Assessor that can able to determine the best possible hazards in the plan and their impacts on entire working plan (Azimi and et.al., 2011). From the risk assessment, there are five types of risks in development of ERP project which are as follows: New and unproven technologies: In general, majority software projects needed the application of use of new technologies. In the ever changing tools, methods, techniques, standards, protocols and increase the requirement of system developments have increased the risks related to technology. In the case of ERP project for Abundant Produce Limited, the changes of occurrence of this type of problem has raised because improper use of technologies have lead directly to failure of project (Hazır, 2015). Users and functional requirements: At the time of development of a project, it becomes important to consider the all requirements of the users such as system features, functions, and quality of service. In the case of ERP project of Abundant Produce Limited, users and functional requirements risk has occurred because at the time of development different modules and their integration, the client requirements have varied along with the new system functioning (Meredith and Mantel Jr, 2011). Application and system architecture: The less understanding towards application and system architecture of new ERP system for Abundant Produce Limited, it has increased the risk for the entire project. This has moved the plan in the opposite direction which may affect the overall outcomes of activities (Müller and et.al., 2013). Performance: It becomes most important to ensure to measure the performance of the project as per the expectations and set performance criteria.

Decline in sales is the major problem being faced by firm and therefore, it is essential for business to identify the issues so that appropriate outcomes could be attained in terms of improving profitability. However, in regard to evaluate the results, it is essential for firm to overcome the issue and thus bring positive outcomes so that brand image of firm could be raised (Gallino and Moreno, 2014).

Following is the aims and objectives that is being discussed underneath- Aim- To analyse the reasons of decline in sales of Sainsbury on the profitability of firm. Objective-\nTo identify the main reasons of decline in sales of firm.\nTo assess the impact of declining in sales of Sainsbury on the profitability of firm.\nTo recommend the strategies through which declining in sales could be overcome.\nliterature review\nThe main reasons of decline in sales of firm\nAccording to the view of Kirilenko, Kyle and Tuzun, (2017)it is stated that there are various reason of declined in sales which lead to impact the profitability of an organization. Sales of product can be declined because it not fulfils the needs and demand of customer. If company fail in making product and services as per taste and preference of consumer, then it directly impacts sale. In modern era, needs and demand of people change with change in time. They look out for new things instead of going on with existing product. Needs and demand of people increases time to time and it makes difficult for an organization to fulfil the needs and wants of time. This decrease the satisfaction level of customer and they switch to other brand product in respect to fulfil their needs and wants. Further, there are many competitors in retail industry who make similar type of products for customer and sale them at lower pricer. Increase in competition level also impact the sale of specific organization. Moreover, to survive in competitive market firm need to lower the price of its product and services which impact the profit of an organization. Therefore, increase in competition level also decline sale which directly impact profit of a company. Pouliot and Babcock, (2016) explained that if an organization not use effective marketing strategy then it also decreases the sale. Company make different type of product and services for its customer, but it need to ensure that customer know about its product and services or not. Moreover, if company not make its customer aware about product and services which they are selling then people will not prefer to buy them. As, it can be stated that people prefer to buy popular brand product. So ineffective marketing strategy also impact the sale of organization which directly impact the profitability. Furthermore, if company not make good quality of product and services then customer may not wish to buy particular firm product and services. It is important for an organization to focus on quality of product as customer mainly prefer to quality at the time of buying product and services.\nThe impact of declining in sales of Sainsbury on the profitability of firm.\nAccording to the view of Feletto, Burton and Egger, (2017) decline in sale lead to impact the profitability of an organization. If sale is declined then it impacts profit because company make product for its customer and if they not buy product and services then it impact sale. Some time company invest huge fund in making high quality product and services and attractive packaging. Further if people not like to but those products then company cannot recover its making charges and unable to make profit. Along with this organization also invest huge expenses in marketing its product and services but due to high price of product customer avoid buying those expensive product may decrease the profit of an organization. Increase in level of competition also diver the mind of customer in buying particular company product and services. There are more choice available for shopper and different company provide discount offer to its customer which grab the attention of large number of customers. This impact sale as well as profit of other organization. Furthermore, if sale is not increase then company cannot make profit to pay salary and wages to its employees. Therefore, it can be stated that sale is very important for an organization in order to make huge profit.\nStrategies through which declining in sales could be overcome.\nGuo and Xiong, (2016) explained that there are different strategies which company can adopt in order to increase sale and make huge profit. One of the effective strategy which an organization can used is effective marketing techniques. Through this company can easily enhance the sale of its product and services. Further it supports in making aware people about the product and services. Company can use modern marketing techniques such as social networking site. Through the help of this company can easily target large number of customer in less time. Company can provide detail information of its product on social networking site for grabbing the attention of large number of customer. Furthermore, there are many advance technology which can be used for making innovative product and services for its customer. If company used new technology and make product which were different from its competitor, then it can easily increase sale. Further, if products are different from its competitor then company can easily keep high price of its product because then it has less competitor. This assist organization in making huge profit. As pre view of Mohammadtalebi, Nasr and Mohammadtalebi, (2016) a company can make product and services focus on fulfilling the needs and demand of its customer in order to overcome decline of sale. For this purpose, firm can conduct marker research for identifying the needs and demand of its customer and focus on making product according to the taste and preference of customer. With the changes in time needs and demand of people also changes, through the help of market research company can easily in identify the needs of people and fulfils it. Further if firm get product as per their needs and want then they will not switch to other brand. Apart from this Company need to ensure that product and services which they are making is of good quality and grab the attention of people. This overall increase sale as well as profit of an organization.\nResearch Methodology\nResearch methodology is an important part of study which enable to present the finding, in an appropriate manner. Furthermore, one of the significant aspect is data collection which taken into consideration by researcher. There are two methods for collecting data that is primary and secondary. Primary information is that information which is fresh and new while secondary information is that information which was already published by different author in books and journals (Patino, Au and Vollmer, 2016). In the present report both primary as well as secondary research is conducted in order to deep understating of research aim and objectives. In primary research researcher used interview method for collecting information. In interview question were asked from different department leader of saisnbury organization. After the collection of data it is important to properly analysis the collected data. On the other hand secondary information is gathered with the support of books, and journals. All the primary and secondary information is presented in systematic manner in order to reach aim and objectives of research. Furthermore, interview is conducted for primary research under which 4 leaders has been selected as sample size.\nPresentation of Research and Evidence\nThe research study basically aims to emphasize on the factors that leads to decline the ratio of sales in Sainsbury; hence according to the research aim, researcher has used various primary and secondary sources (Wirtz, 2012). Herein, this section provides detailed analysis about the information collected from primary and secondary both the sources. Since, books, journals and articles are being accessed in the research work; therefore on that basis, several factors are being explored that has a direct link with company’s sales prospect. While carrying out the study, attention has been given towards the factors that have a direct impact on declining the sales and profitability aspects of the business. Moreover, in this regard it can be said that due to increasing level of competition, company’s profitability aspect is reducing (Stahlberg and Maila, 2013). On the basis of secondary research, it is also ascertained that employees are required to focus on enhancing the service provision dimension so that it can have a direct impact on company’s profitability and success facets. This can be supported with an example which states that customers always prefer to purchase products from those business entities which are highly focused on quality dimension (Siu, 2012). However, currently the sales ratio of Sainsbury also seems to reduce because somewhere Sainsbury is not meeting all the quality dimensions. Apart from this, the use of primary source also depicts that Sainsbury is losing its market share because the business has been focusing on multiple services which not only impacts the sales; but also disturbs other operations.",

It can be considered that religion plays a significant role in society including certain aspects such as beliefs, commitments and levels of engagement of individuals with specific religion. As per views of Dana Bjarnason (2019), it has been analysed that many individuals get highly influenced by their religions norms and values it reflects in their way of thinking and working on daily basis. The religiosity is collectivities and the characteristic of people that shows different features of the belief regarding supernatural and in what manner the social group or people engage in the behaviours concerned to supernatural. It is a kind of religious activity in extreme. It consists the ritualistic, consequential, doctrinal, intellectual, cultural dimensions etc. In addition to this, sociologists of the religion have been observed that beliefs of people. Belongingness and the behaviour are not identical with actual religious belief of an individual. On the other hand, religiosity is an extent to which the religion impacts the societies and also intersects with the other public life area. It explains role that the religion plays in a society consisting extent of commitments, engagement level and beliefs of people with specific region.\nAccording to Anil Mathur (2019), the practice of religion is not only considered as a part of an individual’s culture but it can be described as a cultural belief system of people in society. It involves the criterion of believing and generating values of a person which impacts on their way of thinking and conducting daily work by making decisions. However, it has been analysed that cultural norms are responsible for encouraging to follow ethics by making them honest and true towards various aspects of life. In addition to this, every person has their own culture and religion which motivate them obey related norms and values in order to spend their lives properly. Religiosity is responsible for influencing the behaviours and decision making principles of an individual and various factors of satisfaction as well as well being. People belongs to various geographical areas has different religion and cultural norms which are followed by them in an appropriate manner.\nReligion plays an important role in psychological wellness of people because religious values are helpful in shaping value orientations and motivation in order to succeed work. It consist the fact that hard work and economic success is viewed as a sign of salvation which can be encourage with the help of cultural norms. Meanwhile, religion helps an individual to remain motivated which facilitate to reduce several psychological problems such as stress, depression and anxiety. Moreover, individuals get demotivated when their success delayed or there are facing challenging phases of life then religious principles support them to remain calm and stable mentally.</p>\n<h2>The importance of religiosity for psychological well being of middle aged to the elderly people</h2>\n<p>Religion plays an important role as it is known as protective factor for maintaining psychological well being of people.

Further, the topic is about labour market through which the factors and the changes that this industry has faced due to the workforce of a leading firm Austal are being stated.\nPart 1. Examination Of The Industry With The Help Of Data\nThe workforce is very important as the manufacturing process cannot be carry forward without them. In this sector, there lies a huge employment opportunity for the skilled set of individuals.There is an increase in huge demand of the shipping as its increase in the dependence on the economy. Docquier, Ozden & Peri, (2014) have said well that this increase is due to the fluctuations in the trade that are held globally in the trade. Often it is found that there is always equilibrium maintained both in a case of supply of labour according to the demand. However, according to the latest statistical reports in recent, there is a slight difference caused by 2 percent\nChallenges\nThere are numerous challenges that the industry has faced in the past and is continuing facing some of them. The major ones are getting the ports ready especially for the mega ships, as they need extra space and other facilities. Another major hindrance that comes is the repeated disputes and the negotiation of the same with the workforce working in it (Hollifield, Martin &aamp; Orrenius, 2014).\nVarious Changes That Took Place\nWith the changing time, the business has also undergone a variety of transformations.

          "<h2>Introduction to Social Policy</h2>\n<p>Social policy refers to a mechanism that combines economics, politics and sociology in order to examine that how UK government is addressing social issues for ensuring justice and public welfare. It consists of various rules, regulations and statutory principles that government uses for welfare and protection of the society. The present project report emphasizes upon various kinds of social policies and regulations applied in UK i.e. Poor Law Act, 1834, Welfare state and New Labour Social Policy for examining the mandatory governing principles to ensure public safety and well-being\n1. Importance of 1834 Poor Law in social policy\nIn 1834, UK Parliament has introduced several amendments in Poor Law 1601, called Poor Law Amendment Act 1837 or New Poor Law. The amendments were introduced considering three principles, Malthus, Ricardo’s iron law of wages and Bentham’s principle that people demand relief rather than working somewhere. The legislation plays an important role in the social policy because after such amendments, people believe that the reform will reduce the cost of looking to the poor because they would have stopped the outflow of money to the poor except only in special circumstances. Now, after the reform in 1834, people have to go to the workstations where they are provided with the cloth, food and shelter facilities in exchange for the labor work performed. They are abided by the strict principles, rules and regulations and live in terrible conditions. The law encourages and motivates poor people in the society for working hard to help themselves and take beggars out off the street. It has two priorities stated as moving of people to the urban areas, towns, cities where individual can found employment opportunities and protecting urban payers from the excessive wages demand of migrant people before getting a full-time employment.\nMany individuals react positively to such reforms i.e. Duke of Wellington and Poor law Commissioner named James Kay-Shuttleworth supported the act as they believed that majority of the population were poor just because of their own foolishness. They said that industrial revolution has led too many changes i.e. rapid growth of population, rising rate of unemployment and others, which in turn, increases number of poor in the country. Thus, these amendments are based on the principle of less eligibility and workhouse test will have a serious impact on the poverty in UK. The act was issued on the belief that granting financial assistance, pensions and other benefits can result in serious consequences; thus, poverty is seen as a misfortune and pays focus on improvement of poverty and employment rate so as to make poor people free from the poverty. However, on the other hand, Richard Oastler has argued that new law is cruel by calling workhouses as prisoners for the poor people as they are not maintained in well condition. In response to it, the government has introduced a system of regular inspection of the workhouses. Although the act was issued with the view to reduce poverty; still, its importance is declining with the coming of welfare states in the nation\n2. Progress of social policy between 1900 and 1914\nIn 1900, UK government has estimated that nearly 30% of the population were living at the edge of starvation where they were suffering various issues due to lack of food availability. At the same time, there were high level of income and wealth inequality that were noticed by the government, as a result, during the period of 1906-1914, a number of liberal social reforms have been introduced by the British liberal party that was elected in 1906. It comprises free meals to the children in school in 1906, medical check-ups of pupils in 1907, compensation to workers for suffering from injuries at the workplace in 1906, Old-Age Pension Act in 1908 wherein all the pensioners were provided with the extra pension of 5 shillings, introduction of National Insurance Act in 1911 to provide insurance facilities to all the employees from sickness by paying a weekly premium of four penny and unemployment benefits were also brought in certain specific industries such as shipbuilding.\n\nDespite this, under the social reform, British party had charged high rate of taxes on the rich people so as to collect funds and spent it on the poor, in order to provide better facilities and improving conditions of the poorer people in the society. . In 1909, labour exchange was also introduced to provide help to the unemployed people who are looking for the job by providing them a platform where they can apply for the job in interested field. Apart from this, in 1912, clinics were established in school to diagnose health concerns and illness of the children. In 1914, local authorities were also provided with the government grants to deliver maternal and welfare facilities to the child.</p>",

          "<h2>Introduction to Education</h2>\n<p>Education is the imperative field of learning and development. It helps the company to gain in-depth knowledge of certain aspects and determine the career development of the individual. This report is based on national policies and initiatives undertaken for the education of 1419 year olds. In addition, working with certain age groups in the field of education and training is also emphasized. Above all, relationships between schools and other learning service providers for the 1419 age group. In addition, an analysis was performed on teaching, learning and assessment methods. So the learning styles are also explained to ensure the right type of learning strategy for the students.\nTASK 1\nNational policies and initiatives on education 1419</p>\n<p>For the education of the 1419 age group, the UK government has taken several initiatives and imposed various national policies. For example, 1,419 higher education program reforms focused on preparing graduates for higher education. Likewise, the necessary skills, training and development are also provided to define the UK's economic development (McMillan and Schumacher, 2014). This policy helps to make changes in a planned way so that the new update for 1419 can be implemented. The main goal of this initiative is to provide a wide range of learning pathways for young people and to prepare everything related to their studies. For example, how and where students aged 1419 study and when they graduate, etc. Ofsted School Standards - Ofsted School standards are also set by the UK government which indicates that each student's progress since admission should be reviewed. . In addition, it covers the following aspects and therefore an inspection is carried out. For example, to what extent is the development of skills such as reading, communication, and writing as well as mathematics happening and to what extent students are applying them (Schunk, Meece & Pintrich, 2012). Likewise, it is analyzed to what extent the needs of students with disabilities have been met since joining. These distinguishing factors are taken into account by the competent authority so that an effective strategy can be implemented to address similar issues. It helps allow students to progress from their starting point. This is a factor that helps measure the success of government initiatives (Frenk et al., 2010). Each learner counts Each learner is counted on 5 different things, such as health, safety, enjoyment, and success. Along with that, positive contribution and economic well-being are some of the criteria for students aged 1419. In this regard, the UK government has published Every Child Matters (Green Book). It is shown that students under the age of 1419 benefit from a safe environment and appropriate learning facilities to ensure their maturation and development (Bruner, 2009). The UK Government has also launched initiatives to develop society and the workforce, which take into account the individual needs of people. Therefore, action plans are implemented by the government to bring about stability (Seidman, 2013). This makes it easier to support the UK's economic growth as the workforce is developed through different types of training and development programmes. On the other hand, PLTS is a framework made up of six groups. It includes independent surveys, team workers, effective participants, and self-managed people. In addition, creative thinkers and reflective learners are included in the PLTS framework. This helps to become an integral part of teaching and learning so that the 1419 age group can receive appropriate assistance. Here it is ensured that learners apply the six groups in a very unique way, since all of these groups are interconnected (Knowles, Holton & Swanson, 2014). In addition, the students who form a single learning base receive help from all the mentioned aspects. It facilitates the development of their global skills and ensures their rapid development. On the other hand, the leaflet is prepared for the planning and implementation of the PLTS. This leaflet includes a set of questions about the program such as what to achieve and how and when to achieve it are also outlined in the leaflet. It is effective in achieving the PLTS goal at the right time. In addition, a detailed explanation of the PLTS framework was given as follows Independent Investigator This is the first item related to the PLTS, in which young people under 1419 identify different questions to be answered as well as the problem to be solved. In addition, planning is made to carry out the research so that the consequences of the decision are appreciated. Likewise, issues and events from different perspectives are explored through which individuals can effectively accomplish their tasks (Siemens and Long, 2011). Team Staff This is the second element of the PLTS framework, which focuses on cooperation between people to achieve specific goals. In addition, they confidently accept their responsibilities and carry out their duties. In addition, all team members provide constructive feedback and support to complete assigned tasks on time (Boud, Cohen & Sampson, 2014). Effective Participation This is another element of PLTS where the focus is on problem discussion and solution-seeking attitudes among all team members or learners. In addition, with the active participation of all young people, the task is broken down into manageable steps to carry out learning activities (Calhoun et.al., 2008). In this context, young people seek opportunities by engaging in difficult situations. It explores their capacity to respond positively to new priorities. In addition, Rat people under 1419 should try to control their emotions and establish a good relationship with their partner. Learner Reflection This element of PLTS focuses on identifying opportunities and threats of learners for self-actualization (Frenk et al., 2010). They set goals and success criteria to ensure their own development in the most appropriate way. Creative Thinkers This section focuses on generating ideas and exploring possibilities in young people. It facilitates the adaptation of ideas to the changing scenario so that the knowledge gained can be implemented taking into account the practical aspect.\nLegal framework and key legislation to teachers working with the 14–19 age range</p>\n<p>Key frameworks and laws established by the UK government for teachers working at 1419 years old. These are explained as follows & nbsp; National Professional Qualifications These are professional awards common in Wales, England and Northern Ireland. It is achieved with structured training and assessment programs. However, they are also known as Scottish Vocational Certificates in Scotland (Zimmerman, MurilloSánchez & Thomas, 2011). Moreover, obtaining this award has proven to be effective in determining the quality of teachers of working age 1419. This shows that this fellow has the qualities necessary to effectively deliver learning to students. For example, the NVQ describes a person's role for a current position so that their salary can be determined accordingly. The more experience you have, the more likely you are to be hired. However, teachers must have sufficient experience in the field in which they are providing their current service. This leads to motivate the students and increase their knowledge. For this reason, the government or authority ensures that there are specific criteria for selecting teachers to ensure youth learning (Seely Brown, 2008). In addition, the structured work experience helps the company move forward in the development and social direction. The following key law should be kept in mind when providing education to the 1419 age group. It helps protect the rights of all people in society and gives them equal learning opportunities. These key laws have been outlined as follows Equality and Diversity Everyone has the freedom to pursue an education and be admitted to the school of interest. In addition, the Equality Act ensures that at school and at the training center there must be equality among students. As a result, the government or legislative framework describes that schools and businesses must respect the cultural diversity that exists among teachers or students. Equality Act 2010 The Equality Act 2010 was proposed by the UK Parliament. The main objective of this law is to provide equal treatment to all residents of the country. Under this law, no one may be discriminated against on the basis of age, region, race and ethnicity. It facilitates the development and foresight of the country (McManus and Dhar, 2008). Likewise, in order to obtain public, private and employment services, one must follow this law. In addition, there are special protective measures for pregnant women. As a result, the Equality Act is proving effective in providing education for the 1419 age group. Equipping our teachers for the future This is a legal framework created by the national government to provide New service for student teachers. It facilitates the introduction of the new Qualified Teacher Learning and Competence Award in order to be able to provide better quality teachers in learning centers. Accordingly, other measures are also included, through which high standards are set to support teachers in the workplace (Kim and Free, C 2008). For example, lifelong learning in the UK is promoted through investments in suppliers and partnerships. Here, the existing regulations are also revised from time to time so that the qualifications of teachers can be improved with the introduction of similar training programs. It has a direct impact on reading, writing, numeracy and language skills as well as additional teaching strategies for 1419 year olds. In addition, this section includes offers for internships for teachers, research institutes and scholarships, as well as profiles with partners.</p>",
